Through a telepathic misunderstanding, answers to the name "Me." The nothic is a mutated and corrupted mage with telepathic powers and a piercing, necrotic gaze. He is very agile and fights with his claws as well.

## Relationships
- Hated [[glasstaff|Glasstaff]] because he was responsible for 'acquiring' this creature. It is unclear whether the mage contributed to the nothic's creation or simply assumed the role of its master at a later point.
- Learned a secret from [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan Chokrotsk]]'s mind, but as of yet has not chosen to use that leverage.
- Works for [[the-party|the party]] with the understanding that he can keep any shiny baubles he finds.
	- Me runs the day-to-day operations of the reformed Redbrands organization and has a specialty in information/intelligence gathering.
