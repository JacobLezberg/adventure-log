![[giant-skeleton-image.png|400]]

This giant skeleton was disturbed by [[the-party|the party]] near the end of their exploration of the [[wave-echo-cave|Phandelver Mine]]. Notably, when [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s sword [[calibur|Calibur]] became lodged in one of its bones and was subsequently retrieved, the runes on the blade transformed to reflect its new identity as "*[[calibur|Exossis]]*."

> [!INFO]- DM's Note
*This enemy was improvised roughly 30 seconds before [[the-party|the party]] opened the door. The original adventure had that room full of regular skeletons, but I figured we could make it more interesting!
