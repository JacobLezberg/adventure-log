An invisible creature that lives in the reflection-dimension of the mirror maze. It's exact form and capabilities are not fully known, but it has a human head and three pairs of appendages that act as legs.

The puppetmaster has the ability to stealthily attach strings to creatures, living and dead, and control them, hence its name. Its invisibility is either intrinsic or an exceedingly strong enchantment, as it is unaffected by the death of the creature.

The [[cabin-journal|journal entries from the cabin]] speak of these creatures as though they are numerous and have terrorized multiple groups of wanderers.
