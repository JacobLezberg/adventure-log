Used to be the ruler of [[Waterdeep]], seized control of the throne in Neverember and became its Lord-Protector, but lost control of [[Waterdeep]] in the process. Has designs to gain a hold over more of the Sword Coast.

Though they are mercenaries, a large contingent of Mintarn are currently doing his bidding. Lord Neverember is a proponent of the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] and is directing their outreach efforts.

"After being ousted from his former position, Neverember focused all of his efforts in his role of Lord Protector of Neverwinter, which had slowly begun being restored as a center of civilization in the Sword Coast. However, bitter over this event (*being ousted as the Open Lord of Waterdeep*), Neverember became even more despotic and began to enforce more heavy-handed laws in Neverwinter. He enacted high taxes and harsh regulations on the nobility and guilds in an effort to stifle any political competition, and likewise, it was rumored that he had killed any person who claimed to be a descendant of the Alagondar (*previous royal*) family.

Due to this commitment and his past accomplishments helping Neverwinter and its citizens, the people of Neverwinter finally accepted Neverember as the rightful leader of their city, despite the fact that people from other lands saw him as a tyrant. Even his staunch opposition, the Sons of Alagondar, eventually began to serve under his command at some point before 1491 DR. When followers of Tyr went to Neverwinter to restore the temple of their god, Dagult gave them the Hall of Justice for that purpose and moved into a private villa. This action made him even more worthy of a leader in the eyes of the Neverwintians.

As of 1496 DR (*today*) Neverember holds autocratic power over Neverwinter, and his focus had turned to restoring Castle Never to its former glory."
