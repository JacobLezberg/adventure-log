A banshee who haunts the abandoned town of Conyberry. She has some sort of magical capability to divine information about non-living things, including what happened to them in the past.

Like all banshees, Agatha is hateful and vengeful, but the object of her ire is not known to anyone. She does put value in certain material objects, such as an ornate jewel-encrusted comb, for which she exchanged some of her knowledge.
