> [!INFO]- DM's Note
*Beezer's class on paper is actually Wizard and I don't think even he is aware of the fact that he's actually a wizard and not a sorcerer. He doesn't actually have wild magic or anything of that nature and only thinks he's a sorcerer because his parents, "Always said he had some magic in him."
