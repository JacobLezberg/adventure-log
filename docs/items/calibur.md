A longsword of unknown origin but potent magical capability, Calibur was [[king-grohl|King Grohl]]'s weapon of choice when he was defeated by [[the-party|the party]]. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] took it from the hobgoblin as loot and now wields it as his primary weapon.

In [[wave-echo-cave|Wave Echo Cave]], during a fight with a giant skeleton monster, Calibur became lodged in one of its bones. When [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] pulled it out, the runes on the blade rearranged to form a new name, *Exossis*.
