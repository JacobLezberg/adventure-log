Used as a weapon by [[aliana|The Shadow]], the Soul Lantern housed more than a dozen spirits. By channeling its magic, a wielder could summon a number of the bound souls and issue them commands.

Over time, those trapped inside the lantern lost their memories, identities, and sense of self. Feeling that this artifact represented a cruel and unnatural form of magic, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf Alpensinger]] made a point of releasing the souls after [[the-party|the party]] defeated [[aliana|Aliana]] (where they were forced to arm-wrestle Kleb Fumpton and Rowan Chokrotsk before passing on). [[lantern-spirit|One man]] in particular, however, remains tethered to the lantern and as of yet has not been able to leave.
