Used as a weapon by [[Aliana|The Shadow]], the Soul Lantern housed more than a dozen spirits. By channeling its magic, a wielder could summon a number of the bound souls and issue them commands.

Over time, those trapped inside the lantern lost their memories, identities, and sense of self. Feeling that this artifact represented a cruel and unnatural form of magic, [[Rulkorf Alpensinger]] made a point of releasing the souls after [[The Party|the party]] defeated [[Aliana]]. [[Lantern Spirit|One man]] in particular, however, remains tethered to the lantern and as of yet has not been able to leave.
