The Manta Ray Cloak was found by [[the-party|the party]] in the storage room connected to the arcane workshop of [[wave-echo-cave|Wave Echo Cave]]. It was presumably created with the use of the [[spellforge|Spellforge]], and is enchanted with the spirit of [[Gil]]. The cloak is currently worn by [[Rulkorf Alpensinger]].

When worn, the cloak grants its bearer the ability to breathe underwater and swim with great ease and speed.
