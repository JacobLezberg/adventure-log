This tattered leather journal was found by [[the-party|the party]], hidden under a floorboard in the cabin in the Mirror Dimension of the [[hall-of-mirrors|Hall of Mirrors]]. It contained entries from seven separate writers, which are reproduced below.

> **I think I’m going to die here. I know I’m going to die in this maze but I think I’m going to die here in particular. In this shack. I don’t know if they know I’m here but they’ll probably find me soon. It doesn’t matter. At least it’ll be over. At least it’ll be over.**
> 
> _Well, whoever wrote this didn’t leave a body, so they either disintegrated or walked away. Or maybe they were killed elsewhere. I guess that’s certainly possible. Let’s hope not. This maze is confusing enough already. If anyone ever reads this, look out for the invisible fuckers. If you feel a tug on your arm or something move when it’s not supposed to, take out a sword and spin like a fucking ballerina. Based off our experience it works about 33% of the time. Better than nothing. We’re moving on. Good luck._

> **It seemed like a bad idea at first to make camp in the only structure we’ve seen in days (hours? weeks?) but hey, we’re still here. Judging by the dust that was on this thing, it’s been a long time since the last person/party wrote in this. On the one hand I’m surprised because it seems like there’s no shortage of people in here. On the other, I’m not sure how many make it into this mirror zone. Ditto about the invisible things and the tugging and cutting. Harlan (our ranger and alchemist) has also discovered that strong acid will do the trick to sever whatever ties may be on us. Hopefully this information proves useful.

> We’ve been here for a few days now, which was a mistake. We gave them too long to hem us in. They’re picking us off one by one. They’re taking the bodies. We’re going to make a break for it as soon as everyone’s had a chance to rest. I’m stashing this under the floorboards in case they raid the shack. Yondalla protect us.

> _I’m not sure Yondalla protected them, but in any case they didn’t die here. No way I’m staying in this shack but if you find this, mind what mirrors you break in here. I’ve found that they tend to lead to finding problems rather than solving them. Maybe I’m just unlucky. Peace. --Leah_

> **Well these are all ominous as shit. A little detail would’ve been nice. Corellon, how long have we been in here? How long has this thing been around? Also we’ve been here two days before finding this journal. Yes I read the entry about getting trapped here. We’re being careful though, and are making some good progress now that we have a home base. Breaking the mirrors from the inside seems to act as an instant portal to somewhere else in the maze. Always on this side of the mirrors though. Aviva has an enchanted glass cutter (thank you Xanathar!) and has been able to peek through via small holes. Avoids drawing too much attention. Still a bad idea but hey what else are we supposed to do.

> Been here some time and are still going strong. All the rooms we’ve found are full of monsters except for one that was empty. The search continues, but we’ve found friends too. Maybe.
> 
> Aviva, Garth, and Tanduil are gone and the room that was empty wasn’t empty after all. I don’t know what happened. It was all so fast. There weren’t any of those invisible legged things, but something got her. Something ancient and robed and terrifying got them. And now we can’t close the doorway there. Corellon. Gods. Save us. We were doing so well.**

[[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] added the following entry (along with a [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]] pamphlet):
> *So, it looks like you're trapped in here too. Listen, I know how you got in here: you or one of your party got succubus'ed by some wench . I think it's now a solid moment for you to reconsider your ways and realize that simpin' ain't easy. Now I know that this may be hard to handle. Simping is all you know, the path of least resistance that you've been following for years. But perhaps your current situation has revealed to you the fallacy of this line of thought. If you are ready to change, embrace your true masculine self, and maybe make it out of this hell, take a long hard look in any of the conveniently located mirrors, and read through the pamphlet between these pages.
   The lozenge gules welcomes you,
