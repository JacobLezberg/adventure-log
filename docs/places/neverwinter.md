## Modern Historical Points

## 1385 DR - The Spellplague

In the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR, the Spellplague struck (*more on that later*). Neverwinter was not hit as hard as other settlements in the Sword Coast, and when Lord Nasher Alagondar died, his son, Bann Alagondar, founded the Alagondar royal family that ruled Neverwinter fair and well, allowing the city to prosper in the hard times after the Spellplague. Unknown to the citizens of Neverwinter, however, was the fact that a small plagueland was formed in the Underdark below the city.

## 1451 DR - The Cataclysm

A small adventuring party rediscovered ancient Gauntlgrym beneath the nearby Mount Hotenow. The party, consisting of Dahlia Sin'felle, Korvin Dor'crae, Valindra Shadowmantle, Athrogate, and Jarlaxle Baenre, made it all the way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their Thayan allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge. This briefly awoke the primordial Maegera, who, in a fit of rage, released a burst of energy so powerful that it forced the eruption of the dormant volcano.

The resultant earthquake and combination of pyroclastic flow and lava destroyed much of Neverwinter. A great rift known as the Chasm ripped apart the southeastern quarter of the city, and strange ash zombies and plaguechanged horrors haunted the ruins, being released from the plagueland below Neverwinter. Thousands of citizens died during the cataclysm, including the Alagondar royal family, while many others fled to other cities, leaving only a desperate few to carve out an ill existence among the ruins.

## 1469 DR - Neverember Enters the Fray

In the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR, [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]] of [[waterdeep|Waterdeep]], seeing an opportunity to add to his financial empire, proclaimed to be a descendant of Neverwinter's former rulers and thus the rightful "Lord Protector" of the city, starting the New Neverwinter movement. [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]] invested a great deal of his own personal fortune to hire workers to help to rebuild the city's infrastructure, and Mintarn mercenaries to protect it from monsters and bandits; he also began a strong campaign to buy the interest of merchants to send their caravans again to Neverwinter, and even ensured Neverwintian survivors had enough food and gold in hand.

## 1489~ DR - Semi-Present Day

Neverember was expelled from his position as Open Lord of Waterdeep in the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR, and turned his full attention to Neverwinter. Blaming sycophantic nobles and scheming guildmasters for his political ouster, Neverember taxed the Neverwinter nobility heavily to prevent them from challenging his power, and enacted laws that banned the formation of most guilds. Through the early 1490s DR, Neveremmber would claim that Neverwinter's guilds and aristocracy were responsible for the city's various woes, using them as scapegoats both to rally support among the common folk and to exert more control over the city.
