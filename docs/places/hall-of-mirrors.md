The Hall of Mirrors is some sort of magical space to which a number of travelers have been brought over time. There is teleportation gateway leading here from the [[sword-coast-carnival|Sword Coast Carnival]]'s tent of the same name. It features a maze of mirrors which form hallways that continually rearrange themselves. Certain mirrors (potentially all of them, although the mechanics are unclear) also act as portals into a mirror dimension within the Hall.

The mirror dimension is in some ways less labyrithine as it does not shuffle itself, but it is home to a variety of dangerous and sneaky creatures. After [[the-party|the party]] defeated the [[labyrinth-guardian|guardian of the mirror dimension]] and shattered its core, the mirror dimension collapsed, apparently crushing all those who remained and were not able to travel into the Hall "proper" in time.

The clones from the mirror dimension are all marked with a [[mirror-dimension-symbol-image.jpeg|symbol of unknown origin]], which was also inscribed on the dais in the guardian's lair. Many of those clones have escaped from the Hall into the [[sword-coast-carnival|Sword Coast Carnival]] and beyond.
