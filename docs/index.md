# Home
This is an index (index.md ==> index.html) file. It functions as the "homepage" for its directory and is unique in that it doesn't need frontmatter. If you try to manually navigate to a webpage for a folder that doesn't have an index you'll get a 404 error.

It seems like a good idea to eventually have shortcuts to categories and/or a Table of Contents (and/or description of the party and website). For now, here are some links:

[[quests|Quest Tracker]]

[[session-0.5|Summary of Early Adventures]]

[[session-01|The Beginning (But Not Really)]]
