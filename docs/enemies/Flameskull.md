![[flameskull-image.png|200]]

A chaotic and malevolent entity lurking in [[wave-echo-cave|Wave Echo Cave]]. The Flameskull reanimated a group of dwarven skeletons to fight against both [[the-party|the party]] and a group of mercenaries working for [[black-spider|The Black Spider]]. It seemed to enjoy causing pain and fear, and once it felt cornered it self-destructed to bring its enemies down with it.

The Flameskull can regenerate itself unless the site of its demise is neutralized with holy water. [[the-party|The Party]] was able to substitute molten iron (from blessed ball bearings) in place of holy water to successfully suppress the Flameskull's resurrection.
