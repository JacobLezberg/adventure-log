A member of a mysterious Shadow race, Aliana sought to prevent the party from leaving the Neverwinter Wood. It influenced [[Rowan Chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s dreams, melded with the paladin's shadow, and cast an illusion to lead the adventurers astray. Once discovered, it attacked them, summoning ghostly warriors from its [[soul-lantern|Soul Lantern]] and attempting to sap their strength through magical means. It was defeated by [[Rowan Chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s radiant attacks.

Over some period of time, it managed to collect a number of souls in its lantern, including the [[Lantern Spirit]].
