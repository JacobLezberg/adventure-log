An evil mage who sought to obtain the power of the [[spellforge|Spellforge]] for unkown ends. He [[instructions-for-iarno-albrek.jpg|instructed his subordinates]] to capture or kill [[the-party|the party]] to prevent them from interfering with his search. While our adventurers were able to stop the Spider's minions who went to [[wave-echo-cave|Wave Echo Cave]], they killed [[gundren-rockseeker|Gundren Rockseeker]]'s brother before the party arrived.

The Black Spider is known to frequently use doppelgangers to protect himself from being swept into a confrontation. He has many giant spiders as pets and keeps them close to him.

His current location is unknown.
