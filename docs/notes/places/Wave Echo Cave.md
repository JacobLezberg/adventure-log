Wave Echo Cave is a place of legend that was lost for an unknown amount of time. It is named for the large body of water that meets a cliff face in its northeast section, whose crashing waves resound throughout the cavern.

At one point, it housed the Archivists of the Phandelver Pact, who performed [[Toward Safer Arcane Research and Development.pdf|research]] on magical items. [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter]] set up a mining operation here which attracted the attention of others, including [[The Black Spider]]. Wave Echo Cave is the site of a temple to Dumithorn, a dwarven mining god, as well as the [[Spellforge]].
