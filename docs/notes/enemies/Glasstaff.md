Glasstaff (whose real name was Iarno Albrek) was a wizard who led the band of [[Redbrands]] in [[Phandalin]]. 

## Relationships
- Had a pet rat as a familiar. Little is known about the rat because after it zapped [[Kleb Fumpton|Kleb]] with arcane electricity, he obliterated it.
- Worked for the [[The Black Spider]] in some capacity, as he was given [[Instructions for Iarno Albrek.jpg|instructions]] to apprehend [[the party]].
- Created (or otherwise 'acquired') the [[Nothic]]. It hated him.

## Loot
- A magical glass staff which was imbued with the power to cast *Magic Missile*. Taken by [[Rulkorf Alpensinger|Rulkorf]] after Glasstaff was killed.
