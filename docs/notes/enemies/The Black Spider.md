An evil mage who sought to obtain the power of the [[Spellforge]] for unkown ends. He [[Instructions for Iarno Albrek.jpg|instructed his subordinates]] to capture or kill [[The Party]] to prevent them from interfering with his search. While our adventurers were able to stop the Spider's minions who went to [[Wave Echo Cave]], they killed [[Gundren Rockseeker]]'s brother before the party arrived.

The Black Spider is known to frequently use doppelgangers to protect himself from being swept into a confrontation. He has many giant spiders as pets and keeps them close to him.

His current location is unknown.
