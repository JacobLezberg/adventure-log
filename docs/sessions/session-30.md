# Thus Schemed Zarathustra
**2023-Feb-11**

- Fortuitously strong winds make the journey to Baldur's Gate quick, although some of the crew is exhausted from managing the sails
- There is an air of tension to the city, with more visible guards than [[waterdeep|Waterdeep]]
	- The Flaming Fists are operating out of Baldur's Gate, doing mercenary work and supplementing the city guard. They seem a bit more hardened and capable
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] recognizes one of the mercenary's school ring, denoting him as an alumnus of Rockton, the rival to [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s Brichtenschlag. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is still bitter about the jousting championships from a few years back
- [[the-party|The party]] parts ways amicably with Alabaster, Hanano, and the others
	- The cook gives them a store of magically-preserved food and some of his personal alcohol
- Arriving in the early evening, our trio decide to spend the night in the city and head to Candlekeep in the morning...but there's always time for a pub crawl
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] wins a nip bottle of Fireball from his drinking contest
		- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] passes out, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] accidentally starts a fights by hitting on someone's date
	- As the entire bar erupts into a brawl, [[the-party|the party]] flees the establishment. On their way to the next locale, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] notices a hooded figure trailing them
		- When the dwarf alerts him to this, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] immediately turns and tackles the person, who is revealed to be none other than [[fallon|Fallon]] the bard!
		- He brings them to his complementary rooms at the Blushing Mermaid inn
- Meeting the following morning
	- [[fallon|Fallon]] is banned from Candlekeep, but knows their entry requirements -- and [[the-party|the party]] only has 2 tickets in ([[hall-of-mirrors|mirror dimension]] info & Thunderbird records)
	- [[fallon|Fallon]] wants help breaking in somewhere, and thinks it could provide the third piece of lore [[the-party|the party]] would need
		- Planning meeting tonight in [[fallon|Fallon]]'s room, after he plays his show
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] hangs out at the "Muscle Beach" of Baldur's Gate, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] explores some of the tourist traps at the various gates, and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] visits a number of different temples throughout the city
- [[fallon|Fallon]] lays out his plans for the heist at [[avorio-mansion|House Avorio]]
	- The [[avorio-mansion|Avorio Mansion]] is about 4 miles outside of town. Lord Tactus Avorio lives there, along with his wife Cyrilla and their three children Caethis, Memna, and Leto
		- The Avorios have a few magic items that [[fallon|Fallon]] is after, including the Spellbook of Zarathustra which will be [[the-party|the party]]'s goal
	- Need to bring in 4 members of the Thieves Guild who are collaborating with [[fallon|Fallon]] but have their own targets. It would be prudent not to trust them
	- Couple informants on the inside that can get the infiltration team through the outer gates
		- No magical charms or wards on the outer walls, but inner doors are protected and only able to be opened with special amulets
		- 32 House Guard at any given time, with fixed outposts in addition to roving patrols
	- Needs to be done in 48 hours, before there is opportunity to relocate the items
	- Locations of Primary Interest (all on second floor):
		- Treasury Demiplane
		- Master Bedroom
		- Library
