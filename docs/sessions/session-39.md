# Episode Title
**2023-Jul-16**

- The party flags down another Avowed to give them some information
	- They inquire why Candlekeep is so busy, to which the man offers only that there has been a surge in recent interest surrounding undeath, revivification, and resurrection. Wonky things are happening to people who died and returned
		- Some very rich people are offering large purses to anyone who can fix things
	- They will need to check their Bag of Holding at the entrance to the Pillars of Pedagogy, as the nested extradimensional spaces would be disastrous
- Rowan looks to buy something strange, and encounters a gnomish merchant who offers the lucky paladin a book that is destined to be his (with a four-leaf clover inside).
	- After the transaction, Rowan is nearly-immediately run over by a horse-drawn cart. A good samaritan heals him up, free of charge.
	- He takes some time to consult his new book of etiquette and learns the importance of eating fish patiently. He also decided to rip out the 76th page, which held the pressed and dried clover
- Kleb rails against the bureacracy and shouts challenges to those around him while Rowan and Rulkorf head to the bathhouse to relax
	- Its modest exterior hides a palatial sauna. The duo manage to rest their weary bones
	- After his instigations to fight are shut down by the Avowed, Kleb joins the others
	- Another guest, named Harold, explains to Rowan and Rulkorf, through their conversation, how he was revived a few years ago but has slowly been wasting away. He is here to investigate the nature of the change
- After messing with another guy in the sauna, who seemed like a very amateurish aspiring conman, the party heads to the House of Rest to secure lodging
	- It is also extradimensional, and offers a large number of rooms for only 1 copper per bed
- With that settled, our trio decides to check out the Pillars of Pedagogy. They check the bag into longer-term storage, but take with them relevant items for investigation
	- At the research desk, the party requests literature on a long list of topics, both those important to them as well as a set of red herrings 
	- Rulkorf encounters Bashemyaso, sailor of the Astral Sea. The two trade gifts, with the dwarf giving his copy of Accounts of the Earth Genasi Water Kings and receiving from the Gith-zerai an ornate dagger acquired from the base of Mt. Celestia
