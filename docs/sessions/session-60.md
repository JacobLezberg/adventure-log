# Test Chambers
**2024-Nov-02**

- Explosions have ceased and the fires have been contained although not entirely extinguished yet. Our trio is examining the booby-trapped boat
- Rowan notices a small envelope on the boat, which would be very exciting if he could read. He calls Rulkorf over, who conjures a mage hand to retrieve it
	- The envelope is addressed to Rowan, and invites him and his companions to "a night with our lord Acererak." Upon reading it, Rulkorf passes out, all three of them disappear in a cloud of smoke
- The trio, along with Eugene, find themselves in front of a manor, illuminated from within as the grand front doors slowly open inwards
	- Rowan approaches the window next to the door, and after peeking inside, smashes the glass and climbs inside. The noise wakes Rulkorf
	- Kleb tries to leave, but as he gets to the treeline he is blocked by the same black smoke that brought them here. He plunges into it and reemerges from the other side. Frustrated, he hops on the broom and does a sweep around the structure
		- All of the third floor windows are closed and opaque, but he can see into some hallways and rooms on the first and second floors. Kleb tries to smash in one of the closed windows but is unable to even scratch it
- As they feel oddly rejuvenated and unharmed, Kleb speculates that they might be dreaming
- A skeleton approaches them, but when Kleb recoils in disgust he drops the illusion and takes the form of a man. He expresses dismay at his broken windows, but asks them to follow him into the dining room
	- He introduces himself as "Acererak the Great and Terrible." He explains that the party has made a name for themselves in their exploits, including some extradimensional travel. This Acererak created the Mirror Maze, which they escaped, as well as the Soul Monger, which they are seeking
		- The lich wants to gauge their power so he can make some tweaks in the future
		- The party is going to help calibrate his dungeons, for adventurers need dungeons and dungeons need adventurers.
	- 12 keys will open a door on the 3rd floor, behind which is the soul of one of the party members. Each challenge on the 1st and 2nd floor will yield a key if passed, and 9 are needed to gain access to the 3rd floor in the first place. A map gives hints as to each room's theme, and extra keys will provide them with loot
		- They may leave at any time, but would forfeit the soul
- Chamber: Regicide
	- 5 chess puzzles successfully completed, yielding the first key
- Chamber: Slime
	- 4 slimes of different types vanquished from an alchemist's workshop. Second key acquired
