# Episode Title
**2024-Aug-02**

- The central food storehouse is on fire
	- Rowan conjures a giant ball of water directly above the burning building, and replacement food on the ground
	- Kleb notices charcoal tracks, suggesting the building was superheated rather than some simple arson
- The guard wall, currently unmanned because of the firefighting effort, explodes in flames
	- Kleb goes to check on the safety of the boats, and falls off his broom as he is choked by thick smoke
	- Rulkorf turns into an owl to get a better vantage point but doesn't spot anything (further) out of the ordinary
	- Rowan investigates the original wreckage, which turns up little, and he joins the mundane firefighting efforts for the new problem
- Owlkorf, at Kleb's behest, pursues the broom and leaves the fighter behind. Gripping the wood with his talons, it immediately speeds up and takes him straight up into the sky, and as he tries to wrangle it unsuccessfully, it flies downwards again and hits the water
	- Rulkorf. still weakend from the earlier fighting, is knocked unconscious in the middle of the river
- Kleb notices a piece of metal attached to the oars of the first boat he approaches and realizes it may be booby trapped. Only one of the three boats appears safe, so he leaves the folding boat on the shore for Rowan and rows out
	- He reaches the dwarf but in trying to pull him in, Kleb falls overboard
	- Rowan provides Aid, healing both of his companions, who dive to retrieve the broom
	- Kleb avoids a large crab underwater, snatches the broom, and applies full reverse thrust to surface again
	- All three make their way back to shore safely but exhausted
- Rowan heals Rulkorf, who manipulates the river's water level to cover the remnants of the wall briefly and douse the fire
	- This soaks the villagers and also carries the bomb-laden boats further up the shore
- The bomb is entirely mechanical, seemingly composed of a mechanism to mix gunpowder and oil
- The party finds someone who has experience defusing bombs, so he's going to give it his best shot
