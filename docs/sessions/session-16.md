# Marionette Monster
**2022-Oct-02**

- As the group walks along, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s compass starts spinning wildly and he calls for a halt
	- A thick, humid fog begins to form among the adventurers, and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] fails to return to the ground before his followers disappear
	- The rope goes slack, and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] sees that it was cut at roughly the height of the top of the mirrors. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] rushes down to try to assist the others, but can't judge distance well to the ground and crash lands his broom into [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] looks to his left and sees a reflection of himself reaching outwards from the mirror, but it freezes when the dwarf catches sight of it. He screams (in a very manly way), scaring off the mirror dwarf, who flees into another pane and out of sight. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] comes over and confirms that there is in fact no mirror panel in the pane of interest
- [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] mentions that he also lost his staff to the woman in the carnival, so he can't cast
- They notice a general buzzing noise, seemingly coming through the ear-rings
- The fog grows thicker. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] tries to pick a lucky direction by tossing a ball bearing, which *plink*s around and rolls back past [[the-party|the party]] towards the mirror portal/hole. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] follows it in, and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[ozamataz-buckshank|Oz]] notice that the bearing is rolling in the opposite direction of its movement, as if it were being pulled unnaturally or magically towards the mirror
- After some investigation, [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] wanders off a bit and bumps into an animated skeleton. He makes a very high-pitched scream, alerting the group, and illuminates his mace
	- The paladin and druid ready themselves for the skeleton's approach, while [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] uses a torch of his own, revealing multiple figures coming from the other side of the mirrored hallway
	- [[the-party|The party]] makes quick work of the skeletons, and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] notices certain gaps in the swirls of fog. He thinks there is someone or something very large and invisible that is manipulating the skeletons and standing above them
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] manages to illuminate the figure with shimmering violet light, revealing its form: three pairs of legs supporting a thin body, and arms and hands holding strings
		- The strings are revealed to be connected to [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] the way a marionette master supports a puppet
		- Realizing the danger, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] rushes to [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and tries to cleave the strings with his sword, successfully cutting through almost all of them.  Seeing a few remaining on [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s mace and arm, the fighter pins that arm to [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s side
		- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] tries to slice the strings attached to his arm but misses and hurts [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] by accident. The latter however manages to yank the strings down
		- The creature, bombarded by poison and crossbow bolts, flees across the tops of the mirrors
