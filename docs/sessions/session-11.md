# Back on the Road
**2022-Aug-21**

- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] runs back to the others and tells them that the rings allow for a telepathic link. After a bunch of fumbling, the group manages to deduce that pressing the emerald inset on the band of the ring triggers the thought-broadcast.
	- They note that there is probably a range-based limit (unconfirmed), and there is no separate channel or encryption or anything, so to be wary of others nearby with similar capability (such as other [[lozenge-azure|bluepill]] mages)
- The group heads inside to interrogate the dragonborn sergeant. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is pleased that all 5 of the prisoners seem to be receptive to the tenets of [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]], and releases them from their cells. They are referred to Dennis, Steve, and Jared (three Redbrand recruits) for orientation and induction.
	- The group pull the dragonborn aside, whose name is Arath, for some questions:
		- His group of mintarn was sent by [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]] to support the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] contingent and protect them. While in the field, [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] gave the order to infiltrate the manor, and leave no survivors, including the goblinoid hostage
		- Arath and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] build a bit of a rapport, both having military background
		- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] asks whether Arath knew of [[king-grohl|King Grohl]], which he answers in the negative
	- Turning to the bugbear, the group wants to question him a bit too
		- Feeling like a new bugbear, he says that he is taking the name Dennis as well. To avoid confusion, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] proposes the monikers Little Dennis & Big Dennis, to which the bugbear adopts "Little Dennis."
		- He has no knowledge of [[king-grohl|King Grohl]]'s connections, unfortunately, and had never met [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]].
- On the way back to Stonehill Inn for the night, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] feels an unseasonal chill in the air. He checks the weather with his Druidcraft, which shows that it should be warm and clear-skied in the near future.
- [[the-party|The party]] resolve to leave for Neverwinter first thing in the morning, in the hopes that they can learn more about the workings of the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]], and perhaps interfere with their machinations
	- [[the-party|The party]] stock up on a few supplies from Barthen's, say goodbye to [[sister-garaele|Sister Garaele]] (who blesses them), and head out, using the abandoned wagon left behind by the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] mages.
- [[the-party|The party]] has been in [[phandalin|Phandalin]] for a quite a few weeks and is happy for the change of scenery -- especially [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]
- At the junction of the High Road and Triboar Trail, the adventurers comes upon the traveling circus they had heard about! They park the wagon and head into the [[sword-coast-carnival|Sword Coast Carnival]]
