# Rowdy River Rats
**2023-Dec-08**

- An attempt to snoop around the docks is largely unsuccessful, but Kleb accidentally breaks a crate, revealing a multitude of silvered crossbow bolts
	- These are highly effective against undead and lycanthropes, but are also very expensive. The Order of the Gauntlet must be well funded
- The party discusses this back at the inn, and are satisfied with the preparations and security of the boat
- After a solid night of sleep, Rulkorf, Rowan, Kleb, and Beezer head to the docks
	- The ratio is ok, not amazing. Rulkorf spots an affluent party of men being trailed by a man in a spiffy wide-brimmed hat. Kleb approaches a waitress who looks to be in her 20s, but her voice reveals that she is in fact much older and under a mirage
	- Suspicious guy claims to just be a gambler who dreams of opening his own museum. He isn't aggressive but seems to want to lie low and be discreet
- Rowan "accidentally" bumps into the mate holding the manifest to check people in. As the papers scatter, Rulkorf helps pick them up, noting a group of 5 eastern names that likely correspond to the wealthy group being trailed earlier
- The party is given their consecutive separate bunks, which are small but private. Kleb heads to the wheelhouse and asks around, ultimately gets stonewalled by leadership
	- Elsewhere on the boat he meets a guard or pit boss named Clyde, discusses the boat's security, and gives him a pamphlet. The boat has a ward against hostile creatures, but it is "spotty" sometimes
- Rowan makes a beeline straight for the casino, and tries his hand at roulette. Once Rulkorf comes, the two play some blackjack instead. While the dwarf makes a modest profit, the paladin refuses to quit while he is ahead. Rowan loses about 500 gold pieces over the course of the evening
- Up on deck, Kleb spots a large scarred dorsal fin near the boat. He tries to warn someone about the creature but they pay him little heed
