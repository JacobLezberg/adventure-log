# Riding in the 90s
**2022-Sep-11**

- The riders pick their mounts
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]], using the pseudonym Hugo Estdong, is drawn to the bulette with racing stripes on its back named Funky Cold Medina
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] prioritizes brute size and selects the largest bulette, Big Ben
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] wants the bulette with the best temperament, which is named I Live in My House
- Magic is allowed, and in fact, anything goes as long as you don't harm any spectators. [[the-party|The party]] prepare their gear and spells
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] decides to push his luck and shoots a crossbow bolt at Ja'an D'enver, who dodges it with an acrobatic leap, and charms [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] in return
- The twin announcers, Tom and Jeff, do the introductions and count things down
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and Ja'an D'enver jockey for an early lead, with [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] close behind and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] in the middle of the slower pack
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] consolidates his lead with a cheeky shortcut past the first hairpin, while [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] knocks Evan Kelmp out of the race with a spray of noxious poison gas
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] lassos Ja'an D'enver's bulette, tying them together and gains a small speed boost as his new rival drifts through the turns
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] sees a widowmaker precariously perched in a forested area of the track. He uses a rope of his own to drop it onto the track at the cost of some speed. The other competitors manage to avoid it, with the exception of the Amazing Majesto, who crashes after [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] cloaks it in a cloud of fog
	- Ja'an D'enver cuts the rope tethering his bulette to [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s, speeding him up and slowing [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] down. However, the whiplashing rope strikes [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] in the face, breaking the charm
	- Barack Obama throws an oil capsule behind him to try and wipe [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] out, but the fighter pushes his bulette harder and tries to take advantage of the lubricant to speed up. Managing to maintain control, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] moves back into third place
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] approaches the next tight turn, and using the bond he's developed with his mount, encourages it to dive underground slightly, banking off the ground to his side and take advantage of the centripetal force (bobsled-style)
	- As [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] threatens to pull away from Ja'an D'enver, the bard casts a vicious *Heat Metal*, burning [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] with his own armor and igniting his oil-soaked apparel
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] maintains his pole position heading into the second lap and pumps up the crowd as he goes by, assisted by a flaming, roaring [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]
	- In an attempt to extinguish himself, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] tries to copy the maneuver he saw [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] do earlier and dive underground. He gets a bit too much depth and loses his reins, but thanks to [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s earlier ritual, his buoyancy in the liquefied dirt launches him up and onto the back of Ja'an Denver's saddle
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] scatters some ball bearings behind him as an additional obstacle
	- Neck and neck, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] takes a swipe at Barack Obama and doesn't connect, but throws him off balance enough that he wipes out when Obama's bulette hits a rough spot
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] wrestles Ja'an D'enver in the saddle before winning the tussle and throwing him off their shared bulette
	- At this point, [[the-party|the party]] are the only three in serious contention, with Brennan Lee Mulligan trailing far behind and everyone else knocked out, but realize the circuit has some added obstacles on the second lap
		- A series of log swinging across the track like pendula
		- A number of mages roil the earth, creating a series of moving ramps and ditches
	- The final rankings are:
		1. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]
		2. Hugo ([[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]])
		3. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]
		4. Brennan
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] wins a kiss from Lavender, to be redeemed imminently
