# Old Men and the Sea
**2023-Jan-15**

- [[the-party|The party]] splits up to avoid drawing attention, while continuing their conversation via rings
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] tries to disguise himself a bit by donning his old Redbrand cloak, swapping his helmet for a hat, and trying to turn his strict military gait for a more carefree jaunt
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] knows a paladin in the city, Tauros, who is a public defender, so they decide to give him a visit and see if he can put some pressure on [[alder-wickwire|Wickwire]] in a way that they can't do alone
	- Tauros has an office in the Trades Ward, and the undercover guards meet [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] there
- The group meets the minotaur, Tauros, and his diminutive secretary Regina
	- After magically establishing attorney-client privilege, [[the-party|the party]] explains the situation to their new lawyer and give him the journal, as well as the names of the [[oremaster|Oremaster]]'s crew who could provide testimony or affidavits (including Mezzos and Tesia, the members of the [[merchant-arcane|Merchant Arcane]])
	- He assures them that he can nail [[alder-wickwire|Wickwire]], and once the magistrate is out of the picture, he is confident that the records will be corrected and they can clear their names and recover the Thunderbird
	- Tauros will send word to the [[oremaster|Oremaster]] in the morning
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] arm-wrestles Tauros and loses handily. They all offer amicable farewells
- In the evening rain, [[the-party|the party]] finds a quiet inn in the Castle Ward where they can discreetly lodge for the night
	- At dinner, [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] shares some of the circumstances around how he left his village
- Out on the town, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] notices they're being followed, and alerts the others
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] becomes a dog, tries to tail the tail
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] continue on their way, searching for a bar with Sad Girls (*TM*) in sufficient quantity
	- The stalker vanishes into thin air, which [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] notices, but neither he nor Dogkorf can discern exactly what happened
- Stumbling upon a small group of partiers (Aszchleeighy, Connor, and Keightlynn), [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] flirts aggressively by showing off his cute "seeing-eye dog" ([[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]])
	- They all head towards Jordan's Hammer, the coolest warehouse club of [[waterdeep|Waterdeep]]
	- Before they can reach the club, 6 hooded figures surround [[the-party|the party]] and their companions
		- The ambush team is obviously well-prepared, and [[the-party|the party]] find themselves silenced, with even the falling rain muted around them
- *Combat time*
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] takes a large amount of damage from the opening onslaught of a hostile trio, armed with jitte and hand crossbows. He is forced back and takes a moment to heal himself
		- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] comes to [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s aid and unloads on the nearest enemy with a flurry of blows
	- The second trio approach [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and the civilians. One of the hitmen murders all three of [[the-party|the party]]'s companions
		- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] goes after the least-armored enemy but he is incredibly deft and dodges the blows
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] falls to another series of attacks, but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] does what [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] could not, bloodying one of the hostiles
	- At [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s behest, Bearkorf grabs [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and flees, but gets knocked back into dwarf form before he can escape
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] hops on his broom, chases after his companions, and whips out the magic scroll that he bought in [[neverwinter|Neverwinter]]
		- A necrotic blast annihilates two enemies and rapidly ages two more
	- Blessed by the Goddess, [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] crits on his death save, and returns to consciousness
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] harness the torrential rain, sculpting it into a tidal wave to buffet the now-elderly assassins
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] finishes one enemy off before getting downed and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] kills another
	- The last assassin escapes, but the adventurers have managed to survive this ambush
