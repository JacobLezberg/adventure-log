# Carnival Time

**2022-Sep-02**

- *Flashback to the journey out of [[phandalin|Phandalin]]*
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] checks in with [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] about his powers and "performance anxiety." Apparently his new spell isn't something he knows how to replicate.
  - The guys ask [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] about his time in military school. Apparently he was a member of the Argentine Brotherhood, also known as the Silver Boys.
  - From the wagon, the adventurers start to smell sweets and cooking meats, and see fireworks in the distance. They have reached the traveling [[sword-coast-carnival|Sword Coast Carnival]]!
- *Returning to the present*
  - All three head straight to the Games/Contests tent. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] wins an eyepatch and a laurel wreath for his attempts at the feats of strength (hammer and bell). He flaunts his strength, collecting a bit of an entourage, and goes around asking women for a kiss. One maiden takes him up on his offer, but he quickly discovers that she was a pickpocket and that his money pouch is now noticeably lighter
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] successfully sends a jester for a swim in the dunk tank, winning a second eyepatch. He puts them both on, effectively blinding himself because he thinks it's cool
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] heads to the tent with a chess-playing chicken. After a tense match (which [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] is having interpreted for him) the dwarf forces a checkmate.
  - Upon losing, the chicken transforms into a wizard in a shower of golden light, and the man hugs [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]], tackling him to the ground. He thanks the dwarf profusely for freeing him from his curse, and rewards him with three chickens' feathers, which is all he has to offer
  - Having wished to "be good at chess," the wizard was transmogrified into his avian form by a fey, who has been his handler (posing as a leprechaun at the carnival) ever since. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] realizes that the handler is nowhere to be found, and takes off after him.
    - Using the walkie-talkie rings, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] convinces [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] to join his chase by claiming it may lead them to the thief as well
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] hears the commotion and leaves the tent, but as he is still blind he accomplishes nothing besides smashing into a cart. He encounters the same woman as [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] (although he doesn't make the connection), and she steals from him as well
- The three reconvene, where [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] removes the paladin's eyepatches and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] drags the leprechaun with him
  - With no way to really reprimand him for his trickery, the group ultimately lets the leprechaun go after he tells [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] that he can get his winnings from a lockbox buried by the chess tent
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] realizes the [[bag-of-holding|bag of holding]] is gone, and the group decides that pursuing the woman is top priority. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] already left to pursue her
  - Trying to make himself attractive bait for scammers, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] draws attention to himself, including a official-looking guy in a tall hat. [[the-party|The party]] makes a plan to follow the man, which leads them to the Bulette races
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] gets some information from the man after striking up a conversation to supposedly convince the man to convert to following Tymora.
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] uses [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s spyglass to spot their mark in the VIP section of the stands. An announcement informs them that the prize for winning the bulette race is the hand of the "princess," Lavender Spellman, who is in fact, the wench [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is after
- To maximize their chances of winning, all three decide to enter the race. The full contestant list is:
  - Brennan Lee Mulligan
  - Amazing Majesto
  - Evan Kelmp
  - Ja'an D'enver
  - Barack Obama
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan Chokrotsk]]
  - Hugo Estdong ([[kleb-fumpton|Kleb Fumpton]])
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf Alpensinger]]
