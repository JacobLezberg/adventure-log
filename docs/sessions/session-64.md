# Word Ladder, But Bigger
**2025-Feb-08**

- Eugene and the red dragon trade blows, with Kleb continuing to wail on the dragon figurine
	- The dragon cracks like a pinata, leaking light and deflating like a popped balloon
- The key is still missing because of the note Rulkorf found, but Acererak pops in to manually transport them back and hand over a substitute key
- Their talk with Acererak involves an invitation to strike him, which leaves Rulkorf's hand anchored in space as if it were an immovable rod
	- Rowan takes a short rest and Rulkorf, dismayed that the 'paralysis' has not worn off, is forced to cast a spell to counteract the magical effect
- The Ladder Room
	- A large rectangular stone room is filled with a dozen statues, with one wall featuring a large closed door, and the far wall has the relief of a ladder built into the stone
	- It appears that each statue is on a (~5 ft tall) pedestal, featuring a dwarf in a particular pose or scene. Each pedestal is also labeled with a phrase, and at the end, set into the floor, reads the inscription:
		CLIMB THE LADDER
		FROM BLACK TO WHITE
		BEGINNING IN THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT
	- Each statue, pose and label:
		- Marble: standing, gleaming white;
		- Harpoon: holding a harpoon; BUT A CREATURE FOREIGN TO THESE HALLS
		- Trait: on all fours; SHARE THEIR TRAITS WITH STONE, IT'S SAID
		- Wizard: holding spellbook; MORTAL, CHAOS, ORDER, AIR
		- Dinner: sitting at meal with many plates; SPINNING ON HIGH LIKE DINNERWARE
		- Bread: holding a loaf of bread; CAVERN AIR AND DAY OLD BREAD
		- Mining: holding pickaxe; NO PORCELAIN BUT ROCKY FLAKE
		- Empty: nothing; HERE WHERE TRULY NOTHING IS
		- Rope: holding coil of rope; IS EXEMPTED ONLY IF IT'S FALSE
		- Board: carrying wooden boards on shoulder; BUT TIMBER BOARDS OFT TROD IT 'TIS
		- King: sitting on throne; CONDITION AND A RULER'S MAKE
		- Obsidian: standing, deep black; 
	- And at the other end:
		ENDING IN THE ABSENCE OF NIGHT,
		YOU'VE CLIMBED THE LADDER
		FROM BLACK TO WHITE
	- Rowan tries opening the door, both pushing and pulling, to no avail
	- The group tries extinguishing the torches, but nothing reveals itself
		- They consider the wording of the inscriptions, noticing the rhyme scheme pairs the statues
		- Mining and trait are a different type of stone from the others, which are granite. Mining is made of slate (darker blue), while Trait is made of shale (lighter)
		- Kleb and Rowan try lifting pedestals and pushing some around. The King statue does budge a bit, as does Empty, but Board is fixed. The party tries rearranging the statues to try and match the rhyme scheme

```

- Upon reciting the word ladder in its entirety, the ladder rungs emerge from the wall, and a portal opens up at its top with a key floating before the opening. Kleb grabs the key and they all proceed back to the mansion.
