# The Afterlife is on Hiatus
**2023-Aug-27**

- Resuming combat:
	- The prone attacker fails to shank [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s ankles and his compatriot fails to stab him
	- Dinokorf notices [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] being dragged away and dashes after the pair that is kidnapping him
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] enjoys punching a guy when he's down, especially when he can stab him instead of punching
- Next round
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] breaks out of the grip of [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s target and piles on the prone guy with his warhammer and sword, ultimately knocking him unconscious with a swift blow of his crossguard to the temple
	- The remaining man flees from [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] while the other pair try to push past the dinosaur standing in their way. 1 flees with [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|beezer]], the other doubles back to stab Dinokorf when the latter takes a swipe at him
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] runs in a large arc to gain speed then zeroes in on the guy carrying [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]], making him drop the man with a flurry of slashes and bites
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] gives chase to the fleeing assailant and casts cause fear, freezing the man with his overwhelmingly menacing aura
- Next round
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] takes time to line up a crossbow shot and sends a bolt through the back of the man's head and out the orbital socket. "Be not afraid"
	- One guy blends into crowd, other stands his ground and stabs Dinokorf again. Turns to run, gets his achilles sliced and cracks his head on the pavement
	- Drag [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] back, combat ends
- Search bodies, reconvene
- Bring unconscious (but visible) [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] along with the unconscious assailant with [[the-party|the party]] back to the hotel, passing by the dry docks, warehouse district, and into the Market Ward
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] [[bag-of-holding|bag of holding]] food run, spends the money lifted from the attackers
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] interrogate the man in their room at Kaya's with little luck. The man seems to already consider himself dead, and actively prefers death to answering questions
		- Once [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] returns, the group realizes that the man saying he already died was literal, not figurative. Patches of his skin are gray and withering, and he evidently is being plagued by the Death Curse
		- Upon being informed that [[the-party|the party]] is working to solve his condition, the man finally starts to open up a bit. Over the course of a lengthy back-and-forth, the leper provides the following:
			- The [[zentarum|Zentarum]] took him in as, as they did his companions, and cared for him in return for completing simple jobs and following orders
			- His handler is a man who goes by the name/title of Boss Nero. Nero is not directly or openly tied to the [[zentarum|Zentarum]], but instructions flow through him to all the agents who have been set loose. He is holed up in the Old City somewhere
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] visits Thiel upstairs and informs him of the [[zentarum|Zentarum]] agent they have tied up. The wizard agrees to take custody of the man. He also reminds [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] that at the Temple of Savras [[the-party|the party]] could find Grandfather Sitimbe, who is a useful local contact
	- The leper also tells his interrogators that they could potentially obtain a guide by waiting for an audience with a Merchant Prince
	- Thiel teleports the leper away, and after a brief conversation, sends the trio away once more
