**2022-Jul-22**

*We were finally able to have an in-person session! Thanks Williams!*

*Turns out we also all got Covid. Thanks Williams!*

- As [[the-party|the party]] departs from [[sister-garaele|Garaele]]'s house, they are approached by none other than [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]], who seems very eager, almost desperate, to have a conversation
  - He asks to chat, and when met with reluctance and disdain, offers to buy as many rounds as they want at the Stonehill Inn. Not ones to turn down free alcohol, they agree to follow and at least hear him out
- Once settled in the corner of the empty tavern, [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] begins questioning them about what happened the previous night, what the goblins wanted, and whether they knew anything about the "[[nothic|one-eyed monster]]" that had attacked the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]
  - The adventurers gave him very little information. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] shared [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s realization that the goblinoids worked for [[king-grohl|King Grohl]], but omitted their history with the hobgoblin.
  - [[toby-keith-blackbird|Toby Keith]] raised [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s ire by implying that [[the-party|the party]] would not be able to protect [[phandalin|Phandalin]] forever, and when pushed by [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]], he stated that he was merely trying to piece together the threats that challenged peace and order.
    - "You see, our mages weren't able to capture that freak last night, but we did track its location. It turns out that it returned to the same place you all departed from this morning."
- Shocked that the bluepills had in fact successfully tracked the [[nothic|Nothic]], and realizing they had been lured into a trap, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] immediately lunged at [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]. He managed to tackle [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] from across the table, but felt himself slipping into an unnatural sleep before he could do anything besides bring the man to the ground.
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] also moved to strike [[toby-keith-blackbird|Toby]] Keith, but fell unconscious before he could accomplish much
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s observant nature, which he had honed over the past weeks of adventure, helped him notice a pair of blue-robed figures visible through the tavern window behind [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]. Hoping that whatever magic which had rendered his compatriots unconscious had a short proximity, he rushed across the room and towards the door
    - A salvo of firebolts punches through the wall of the tavern, one of which strikes [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] in the back. [[toby-keith-blackbird|Toby Keith]] draws his sword and turns to chase after the dwarf, satisfied that the others have been neutralized
  - In [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s dream, he find himself talking to an old friend from military school who became an armorer. He is delighted to see the man, but before they can reminisce for long, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] gets an uncanny feeling that something is wrong. Whether through fate or sheer force of will, he remembers that his companion had been killed years ago and realizes that he must be dreaming. Suddenly awake, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] remains on the floor, trying his hardest to look relaxed and asleep in order to catch [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] by surprise
    - In the depths of [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s mind, he too finds himself chatting with old friends. Specifically, he is having a drink with the fellow members of his Holy Order. Sensing nothing amiss, he continues to dream
  - Back in the tavern, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] returns fire with a shower of ice fragments and turns into a black bear. Mixed with the ozone and ash of the firebolts, he identifies four distinct smells -- there are more enemies outside than he originally thought
    - [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] hesitates to attack the bear himself, but he communicates the situation to the mages outside telepathically, and they send a salvo of firebolts into the room, striking [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] once again. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] attempts to kick [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] or sweep his legs, to little effect, before opting to rise to his feet
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s dream continues, and he starts to feel that something is off. What are they still doing pregaming at this hour? Someone in town owes him a debt, and unfortunately for them, it has come due. He sets off with his comrades, singing a boisterous song
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] decides the best defense is a good offense, and smashes through the weakened tavern wall. With a terrifying roar, he mauls the nearest mage and sends the others scattering
    - [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]], furious that his plan is unraveling, and that [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] still doesn't remember him from school, stabs the fighter with his shortsword
    - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] finally makes it to his feet and returns the favor, slashing at [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]. The sounds of their struggle, as well as the roars and fighting outside, finally penetrate [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s mind and pull him back to reality
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] takes out two more assailants with his claws and teeth, and once he grows tired of chasing and failing to catch the final mage, reverts back to dwarf form and uses his staff to finish off the fleeing man.
    - Inside, the injured [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] trade blows, which eventually devolves into throwing their weapons at each other. With a gruesome finality, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] unseams [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]], splashing blood across the bar
    - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] finishes his ale, tosses a coin to the bartender who had been hiding under the countertop, and heads outside with his friend
