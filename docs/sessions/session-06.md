# Kicking Ass, Taking Prisoners
**2022-Jun-18**

- Combat begins!
	- 3 Bugbears and 5 goblins rush into the square, where they are met by an excited [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]], bristling with weapons. He attacks with a flourish, but his blows glance off harmlessly, as does [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s radiant mace.
	- The bugbears counterattack, inflicting substantial damage to the pair
	- As [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] rushes into the fray, he summons a healing spirit near [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and as takes a chunk out of one bugbear with a clawed swipe. The wound hisses with an acidic sting
	- The goblins fire their bows and throw their bolos, to little effect. They are slightly stunned when [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] parries an arrow out of midair with his sword
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] offers the goblinoids a truce, but after one beat without a response, he performs a sick combat roll and slashes at the legs of one bugbear
		- He hears one shout to the other about notifying "the king." As the battle goes on, he deduces that the enemies are interested in [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s armor (which he stole from [[king-grohl|King Grohl]])
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] bobs and weaves, and with a quick incantation creates three afterimages of himself. Calling out to the others for a health-check, he sets up an alley-oop for [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] with the healing spirit
	- The goblins form a firing line, but reaching for their backup bolos proves time-consuming as the cords are unfortunately tangled
	- One goblin turns to flee, taking off towards the south. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] tries to recall him with a *Command*, but his divine connection fails him. Flustered and a little desperate, the paladin takes off after him but [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] impales the goblin with a trio of magic missiles, dropping him to the dirt.
	- The rest of the goblins break formation and scatter, but are quickly cut down by [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s barrage of magical darts and a particularly brutal thunderous blast
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] knocks the bugbear unconscious for later questioning
-  [[the-party|The party]] levels up!
