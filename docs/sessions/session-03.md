# Episode Title
**2022-May-14**

On their way back to Phandalin, the party sees a wagon approaching slowly with an armed escort. The wagon is emblazoned with the seal of Neverwinter and appears to be carrying something important.

Kleb and Rowan feel its important to establish dominance over this armed caravan, so they spread out to block the road. A robed man hails them and announces that he is spreading the good word of Lozenge Azure. To Kleb's absolute disgust, the man offers him a flyer. Kleb cuts his own cheek with a knife, bloodies his hand, and slaps the paper out of the man's hand before dropping flyers of his own and stomping off.  

Rowan and Rulkorf step aside and call out to the man in an attempt to deescalate. They learn that his name is Belothor and some of his companions had split off towards Phandalin earlier. His group is heading in the direction of Triboar. As the trio walk away, Kleb shares a bit more about his philosophy and how he finds the Lozenge Azure followers pathetic and unmanly. The party makes it back to town before nightfall and sets off towards the Stonehill Inn, noting the presence of more wagons from Neverwinter outside Barthen's Provisions.

In the central clearing of Phandalin, a crowd has gathered to listen to an orator preaching the word of Lozenge Azure. Kleb starts to heckle him, but realizes this man looks familiar. He can't quite place him though, and settles for raucously booing him. Rowan is disappointed that none of his men from Tresendar Manor are here to disrupt the proceedings, but he does spot Sildar at the edge of the crowd.

As the orator finishes and the crowd begins to disperse, the party walks closer and overhear Sildar arguing with the man about jurisdiction and propriety. They form up opposite the Lozenge Azure followers who are accompanying the man. The speaker, a one Toby Keith "TK" Blackbird, recognizes Kleb from military school. Kleb, however, doesn't remember him at all which totally pisses him off.
