# Poppin' Pills
**2022-May-14**

On their way back to [[phandalin|Phandalin]], [[the-party|the party]] sees a wagon slowly approaching with an armed escort, emblazoned with the seal of Neverwinter. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] feel it's important to establish dominance over this armed caravan, so they spread out to block the road.

A robed man hails them and announces that he is spreading the good word of [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]. To [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s absolute disgust, the man offers him a flyer. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] cuts his own cheek with a knife, bloodies his hand, and slaps the paper out of the man's hand before dropping flyers of his own and stomping off.  

[[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] step aside and call out to the man in an attempt to deescalate. They learn that his name is Belethor and some of his companions had split off towards [[phandalin|Phandalin]] earlier, while this group is heading in the direction of Triboar. As the trio walk away, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] shares a bit more about his philosophy and how he finds the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] followers pathetic and unmanly. [[the-party|The party]] makes it back to town before nightfall and sets off towards the Stonehill Inn, noting the presence of more wagons from Neverwinter outside Barthen's Provisions.

In the central clearing of [[phandalin|Phandalin]], a crowd has gathered to listen to an orator preaching the word of [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] starts to heckle him, but realizes this man looks familiar. He can't quite place him though, and settles for raucously booing him. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] is disappointed that none of his men from [[tresendar-manor|Tresendar Manor]] are here to disrupt the proceedings, but he does spot [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] at the edge of the crowd.

As the orator finishes and the crowd begins to disperse, [[the-party|the party]] walks closer and overhear [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] arguing with the man about jurisdiction and propriety. They form up opposite the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] followers who are accompanying the man. The speaker, a one [[toby-keith-blackbird|Toby Keith "TK" Blackbird]], recognizes [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] from military school. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]], however, doesn't remember him at all which totally pisses him off.

[[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] informs [[the-party|the party]] that the men have the blessing of [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]], ruler of Waterdeep and Neverwinter, which convinces them to refrain from starting an all-out brawl. Still adamant that [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] has no place in [[phandalin|Phandalin]], the group heads to the tavern to begin their scheming.
