# An Ambush Repulsed
**2022-Dec-04**

## Round 1
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] isn't sure whether Onyxbeard's flying cutlasses are animated through magic or operating under their own power, so he just attacks the pirate captain directly
- After landing a slash, Captain Klubch shoves his foe backwards, who slips on the sleet and falls prone. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] presses his advantage with a flurry of strokes
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] also slips, but manages to crawl his way out of the storm. After picking himself up, the paladin goes after a nearby pirate with his sword
- The pirate crew largely avoid losing their footing in the storm, but are slowed down and do not advance
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] centralizes himself and throws up a protective spell, creating clones of himself
- A mage on the enemy ship dispels [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s hailstorm, and everyone sees the precipitation halt in midair before blinking out of existence. Onyxbeard gets to his feet and slashes [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] a couple times
- The allied sailors hold their own, including a couple firebolts from Mezzos and Tesia

## Round 2
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] find himself surrounded and staring down the pirate captain. He tries to pick up Onyxbeard for a wrestling throw but gets punished for the reckless attempt and is knocked to the deck. He gets up quickly
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] also tries to shove a pirate into the ocean, and after failing, takes a moment to heal himself
- The pirates continue their skirmish with the sailors
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] sends [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] a healing spirit, which the latter wears as a shawl, and sends a noxious poison cloud in the face of a pirate
- The flying cutlasses come at [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] but both miss.  The enemy mage sends a blast of wind across the [[oremaster|Oremaster]]'s deck

## Round 3
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] cuts through the gust with his sword and stands his ground, before rushing to the stern of the ship and using the ballista bolt's tether to zipline down to the deck of the pirate ship. The poor unfortunate pirate at the other end meets the business end of [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s warhammer
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] sends a pirate head-over-heels over the railing, and failing to dislodge the nearby grappling tether from the ballista, sprinkles ball bearings in the "landing zone" for an approaching pirate
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] gets pushed back by the wind but looses a salvo of magic missiles, knocking one pirate into the sea as he was trying to cross between the ships in additionto disrupting the concentration of the enemy mage
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] is hit by a flurry of blows from Onyxbeard and his flying sword while [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is blasted by a spell from the pirate witch

## Round 4
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] annihilates the enemy in front of him before turning on the witch. As he approaches her, the rigging jumps out to wrap him up and restrains him in a net
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] uses his intimidating aura to freeze the pirates around him in fear and conjures a longsword to duel Onyxbeard's cutlass
- The pirate crew forcibly dissipate one of [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s mirror images, but one enemy on the opposite deck is so scared of the paladin that he takes off running
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] heals [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]], stalks up behind Onyxbear and turns into a bear
- Witch tries to put [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] to sleep but the extra vigor from the healing words keeps him awake
- Onyxbeard, growing more desperate, focuses all his capabilities on [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]

## Round 5
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] breaks out of the magical netting and fishes his cologne out of the [[bag-of-holding|bag of holding]]. He manages to spray it directly in the eyes of the mage, stunning her
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] finishes off the flying cutlass with his own animated weapon, cracking it with a relentless onslaught and finally breaking it in two
- One pirate jumps overboard in terror and the others keep their distance from [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]. A few of them see Mezzos as an easier target and chase after him
- A giant bear paw swipes Onyxbeard overboard. He cartwheels over the railing, bouncing between the ships and into the ocean. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] takes off to try and help Mezzos

## Round 6
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] disperses the pirate witch's afterimages with a couple attacks, which let his warhammer strike true
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] uses a bench on the [[oremaster|Oremaster]]'s deck to vault the ball bearing trap he had laid earlier and comes to the aid of a sailor who is locked in combat with a pirate
- Despite the loss of their leader and the decimation of their ranks, the remaining pirates refuse to surrender
