# Hot Exit
**2023-Apr-02**

- Avorio commands Rowan to *Approach*, but the paladin resists
- Spiderkorf flees out the 2nd floor window without being detected, and once on the ground drops his Wild Shape, returning to dwarf form
- Fallon makes a zone of silence and Kleb flicks one of his fireball marbles towards the head table
- Commence Initiative! Round 1:
	- Half of the lord's retinue suffer severe burns, but the lord and lady avoid serious harm. Kleb stares them down and solemnly throws another bead, then falls back to the side door
	- Lady Avorio escaped the flaming circle of silence and shrieks for guards before trying to trap Kleb in a bubble of force, but misses him
	- Rulkorf wolves
	- Fallon runs to Kleb and Rulkorf, preparing to defend the trailing Rowan
	- Tactus grins madly and joins his wife, promptly healing her wounds. The remaining henchmen are unable to extinguish themselves and do little more than scatter flames on the carpet
	- Rowan, instead of joining his companions, strides towards the couple and looses his intimidating aura, which seems to affect the lady but only emboldens the lord. He also conjures a spiritual sword and draws some blood from Tactus. The enemy paladin's armor shimmers, suggesting it involves some sort of glamor
- Round 2
	- A couple of wolves attack Cirilla while the rest guard the doorways. Kleb tosses yet another fireball at the couple and leaves without looking at the explosion
	- Lady Avorio banishes Rulkorf from the material plane with a flick of her hand. He finds himself in a harmless grassy demiplane, but his wolves also disappear, and for the time being the dwarf knows no means of return
	- Kleb and Fallon flee, but Rowan is intercepted by a flaming Tactus, with sword drawn. As he settles into a fighting stance, Rowan tries to take on both of them simultaneously and quickly realizes he needs to flee as well
- Round 3
	- The fire is spreading and the room fills with smoke as the ceiling is set ablaze
	- Kleb finally pieces together most of what happened to the dwarf and realizes the group needs to stand and fight at least for a little while. He uses his new favorite form of confrontation, a ball of fire, once more, then action surges to do it again
		- Lady Avorio is turned to ash as Rulkorf phases back into existence. Kleb carries him away from the burning building
	- Rulkorf sees guards rushing in from south side of the grounds and turns into a horse, paying Kleb's assistance forward by giving Fallon a ride northward. Fallon provides magical heroic boon to his mount
	- Rowan continues to run away from a furious Tactus' threats, challenges, and holy vows of enmity. Our brave paladin dashes through the kitchen and spills soup in his wake
- Round 4
	- Kleb dashes ahead towards the exfiltration point, along with Horsekorf and Fallon
	- Tactus overtakes Rowan and blocks his exit, but he is unable to hold his ground when Rowan pushes past him and scatters a blockade of ball bearings behind him
- Round 5
	- More guards burst out of a nearby building, and one catches Kleb with a sword swing as he runs by. Rulkorf reaches out as he approaches the wall and instantaneously forms a door from the stone
	- Tactus swings at Rowan but misses, and with his weight severely off-balance, is unable to recover when he is shoved back. Tactus wipes out on the ball bearings and is left on the floor as Rowan rejoins the others
	- Kleb meets up with the paladin as the two head to the exit but revokes the paladin's Bag of Holding privileges for being too irresponsible. He takes out his crossbow and looses a bolt at a pursuing guard
- The rest of the egress consists of a retreat in rough formation while Kleb lays down suppressing fire
