# Paying Savras A Visit
**2023-Sep-04**

- [[the-party|The party]] decides to visit Sitimbe at the Temple of Savras. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] hitch a ride on the brontosaurus express, although [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] opts to run there
	- At the end of the line, the pair exit in front of the Harbormaster's office, which has a bulletin board out front, and head to the temple
- Savras is a god of foresight, divination, and truth. While not among the most popular in the Pantheon, the lawful-neutral god has a fairly devout following here
- They find [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] exercising shirtless in front of a crowd of nuns. Two of them eagerly agree to escort him and his companions into the temple
- Sitimbe is an old but lithe man, and when [[the-party|the party]] enters they find him conversing with two men in black armor
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] reads the lips of the priest and one of the armored guys and gathers that Sitimbe is refusing to aid them in some endeavor and rejecting a bribe in the process. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] IDs the figures in black as heavily armed and armored [[the-zentarum|Zentarum]]
	- It does not seem that the [[the-zentarum|Zentarum]] fighters recognize [[the-party|the party]] at all, and the duo leave without further incident
- [[the-party|The party]] follows the priest to the sepulcher so they can speak privately. They request aid in locating [[ozamataz-buckshank|Ozamataz]], and Sitimbe agrees in exchange for a small donation to the temple. When challenged on how this donation differed from the bribe he was offered earlier, the priest explains that the [[the-zentarum|Zentarum]] were looking for Artus Cimber, a Harper, and he refused to help simply because he was unable to do so.
	- His insight is limited -- for example, he cannot locate the lost city of Omu beyond merely viewing a black obelisk in the jungle
	- Can bring [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] to help uniquely identify [[ozamataz-buckshank|Oz]]. Their familiarity will help make a stronger connection
- The group uses the rest of the afternoon to go on a bit of a temple crawl -- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] wants to visit the house of his goddess Tymora, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] seeks the services of the craftsmen of Gond, and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s interest is piqued by the idea of finding followers of Sune (beauty and passion)
	- Sune's temple looks abandoned and in a state of disrepair. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] can't even sense consecrated ground here, which is highly unusual and a bit concerning
	- The front door is locked but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] opens it with his magically-enhanced warhammer, and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] dons his night-vision goggles to explore the interior
	- As they explore the temple, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] remembers that Sune's domain was destroyed two decades earlier, which explains the empty and desolate structure
	- [[the-party|The party]] agrees that this would make a good safe house and/or defensible location, but hopefully that won't be necessary
