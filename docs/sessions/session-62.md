# Episode Title
**2025-Jan-11**

- Still in combat with the Beholder, Kleb gets paralyzed, Rowan gets charmed, and Eugene approaches menacingly
- Kleb saves out of paralysis and Rowan commands the beholder to "stargaze," hoping that in appreciating the stars it will be forced to avert its gaze temporarily (along with the antimagic field. Eugene approaches menacingly
- An eye-stalk death ray disintegrates Kleb, his clothes, broom, and all organic matter on his person. His armor remains, covered in a layer of ash that used to be the fighter, as well his metal rings
- Rulkorf and Rowan use what magic they can to attack the beholder and protect Eugene, but the antimagic field nullifies the ward
- The dwarf finds himself pinned down behind a pillar and decides he needs to bring the fight closer. A misty step + thorn whip combo pulls the beholder towards them all, and while Rulkorf is subsequently hit by a slowing beam, his two remaining comrades unload on the beholder
- Eugene ends the antimagic field by cutting the muscles around the beholder's eyelid, and Rulkorf uses his remaining magic missiles point-blank to finish off the creature
- Rowan revivifies Kleb, which animates the ash cloud inside his armor. The party discovers Kleb is mostly corporeal and can fly, and can avoid physical contact with material objects if he chooses
- Kleb picks up the key, and the party is jettisoned back into the mansion. They all feel rested and restored, and the only marker of their ordeal is a glass bead in Kleb's hand, which has ash and dust inside
	- Rulkorf fashions a little rope harness for it so it can hang off of Kleb's bead necklace
	- Presumably, in case of emergency, he can smash the bead to regain the gaseous form
- Rulkorf notices motion from the next chamber, and advances while motioning to the others. Kleb sprints past him and comes face to face with a six-legged panther-like creature
	- Kleb dives towards it, realizing as he falls towards the floor that this beast was an illusion. The real one leaps onto him from above, and pins him to the floor, knocking away his sword
	- Rowan shoves it with his shield, Kleb dodges the creatures sharp backpaddle appendages, and counterattacks, slaying the beast
	- With time to inspect the corpse, they realize it was a Displacer Beast
- Breaking a window summons Acererak, and they have another unproductive argument with the lich
- The party attempts to take a short rest, but upon noticing a suspicious flickering "heat mirage" effect at the top of the stairs, they decide to flee. A translucent ooze settles in the room shortly after they leave for the next chamber
- Throw Back room
	- The party finds themselves in a basic dungeon anteroom, in the center of which is a trench filled with green slime
	- A kobold sees the party and raises the alarm before Rowan can paralyze him
		- Kleb kills him with two well-placed crossbow bolts but 3 more kobolds rush into the room
	- Rulkorf opens a portcullis from the outside with his mage hand while the others slay most of the kobolds
	- One kobold flees and Kleb interrogates the last one
	- Rounding the corner behind the portcullis, the group seeds the golden key floating in midair, and without any further surprises are able to simply grab it
		- The throw back...was to a starter dungeon
