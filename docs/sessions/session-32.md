# Bookcasing the Joint
**2023-Mar-10**

- Upon entering, the trio discover that the event is a masquerade, and don black half-masks
- Tactus Avorio, the lord of the house, greets the newcomers. He is wearing a gold suit but rather than being tacky, Tactus is resplendent
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] wanders off so that he can use his divine sense, and gets strong feedback of a holy or consecrated aura coming from the basement level
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] schmoozes and makes a great impression. Other guests all belong to minor houses
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] assertively establishes his presence in the main room before crossing outside near the fountain and noticing two guards slumped on a bench. Upon closer inspection he realizes they've been killed, presumably by the thieves
- Baron Pellen, manager of an independent family business, speaks to [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] of rumors surrounding mysterious illness and the decline of certain greater houses. He seems to be subtly judgmental of [[the-party|the party]]'s presence at the event, but thinks highly of Lord Avorio
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] do some snooping around the foyer but discover nothing,and turn their attention to the closet/fireplace area. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] inquires about the Avorios, and the other guests share what little they know -- Tactus is a big game hunter while Cirilla is an avid collector of magical items
	- The dwarf tries to get a personal audience with the lord to see his hunting trophies, but is directed to speak with the lady instead in the library
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] joins [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] in the library, meeting up with Cirilla and a few other party guests, while [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] heads into the study. The paladin finds a small group drinking, and he flexes his inner alcohol snob, winning them over by sharing some of Hanano's special drink as well as his bottomless vodka supply
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] makes sure they are thoroughly inebriated, even throwing out a *Command Drink*
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] pokes around in a side room dedicated to the goddess Waukeen, who very closely resembles Tymora
- Cirilla poses a riddle to the duo, solvable entirely from within the library:
	- *"In order to gain all knowledge, one must know where to start. Count on your enemies. This room is dedicated to the defeat of all within."*
	- After they struggle for a bit, she reveals a revised statement: *In order to gain all knowledge, one must know where to start. **Count in your enemies, but not for their heart.** This room is dedicated to the defeat of all within.*
	- The library seems dedicated to hunting and monster slaying, with books on different species and conditions. There are a number of paintings in the library, each depicting different monsters (17 total, split among 7 unique kinds). The number of each type of monster, used as an index into its name, selects a letter. This anagram can be solved for: OWLBEAR
- With the answer written onparchment, a bookcase splits apart to reveal a set of hidden tomes
