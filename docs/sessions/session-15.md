# Going in Circles
**2022-Sep-25**

- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] locks eyes with the lumbering monstrosity on the other side of the mirror portal, but can't close it fast enough to prevent a confrontation
	- The creature has white skin that looks like marble, silvered eyes, two stump-like protrusions on its back, and wields a gigantic mace that is in proportion to its 8+ foot frame
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] tanks a swing from the mace and manages to put the extra walkie-talkie ring on the creature's finger
	- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] pulls him away and the portal closes, but not before the creature telepathically begs them to stay away and get out
- Having sealed off the creature and lost track of it, [[the-party|the party]] deliberates for a while before returning to their original plan of heading to the closest edge of the maze with [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] providing guidance from his perch on the flying broom above the maze
- From high up above the mirrors, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] sees some sections are foggy/blurry while others are clear. He notes two figures walking through a section of the maze, and upon further investigation they appear to be a half-orc and a dwarf
	- He guides [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] to the pair, and descends so they can all talk. 
		- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] provide pseudonyms (Erasmus and Carlos, respectively) while [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] uses his real name.
		- [[ozamataz-buckshank|Ozamataz Buckshank]] the half-orc apparently was duped by a woman as well (she took his enchanted bow), which is why he is here along with his friend [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer Twelve Washingbeard]]. They were led to the [[hall-of-mirrors|Hall of Mirrors]] by a woman in a red dress named Scarlet, while [[the-party|the party]]'s guide was named Lavender and wore a purple dress
			- The orc is a ranger of the forest, while the dwarf is a sorcerer, and the pair encountered the traveling carnival near Port Nayenzaru in the land of Chult (to the south)
			- They seem to have been here for 3 days, but their sense of time and orientation is all screwed up
			- Having built more of a rapport, when [[beezer-twelve-washingbeard|Beezer]] questions Erasmus for family name, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] opts to reveal his true name and background
	- The travelers decide to advance together and try to escape the maze as a group
