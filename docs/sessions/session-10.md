# Interrogation

**2022-Aug-14**

- [[the-party|The party]] attempt to interrogate the mintarn who surrendered, to little avail. The soldiers do nothing but repeat their names, ranks, and serial numbers
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] manages to intimidate the rookie enough to get him talking a bit (he confirms that [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] gave the orders and sent them to the manor), but the other mercenaries pressure him to shut up.
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] prepares to run one of them through with his rapier, but hears a voice and feels the presence of Tymora, imploring her champion to restrain himself
  - At the sensation of her influence, the paladin holds his strike, and is rewarded with a bit of the divine link that he had missed. He isn't sure how, but he is certain that he can cast *Zone of Truth* temporarily, and does so
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] takes two of the mintarn inside to the empty jail cell, then heads back toward the Stonehill Inn to retrieve the other half of [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]'s body, leaving [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] to interrogate the other pair of mintarn
  - The rookie explains that the mercs are escorting the diplomatic envoys ([[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]) for [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]], and that [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] gave the specific order to leave town and then head to [[tresendar-manor|Tresendar Manor]]. However, he doesn't seem to know anything else of importance, and the other mintarn refuses to speak
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] returns with the other half of [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]. Feeling they need to resort to more serious measures, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] asks the [[nothic|Nothic]] to come outside and deal with the quiet one. He is happy to oblige and peers into the soldier's mind, revealing that only a few of the mercenaries knew their full mission at the manor, of whom this guy and the dragonborn are the only ones left
  - [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]] told them to storm the manor, take no prisoners, and take the prisoner from [[the-party|the party]]'s jail. It is unclear how they knew about that bugbear
  - The [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] were not expecting the goblin attack (or the [[nothic|Nothic]]'s harassment).
    - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] firmly believe (and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] maybe believes?) that the attack was a false flag, organized by [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]] to improve the image of the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] diplomatic party
- After confirming that the rookie, named Ben, will go home and quit mercenary work rather than return to Neverwinter, [[the-party|the party]] keep their promise to the other mintarn and let the boy leave
  - The group take the dragonborn and the other mintarn down to the jail cell, and let the [[nothic|Nothic]] take care of the bodies
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] feels a flicker of Tymora's presence return to him as [[the-party|the party]] settles in for a short rest. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] attunes to the Bahamut breastplate he's been carrying, learning that it provides resistance to breath weapons.
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] heads back into town to visit the blacksmith about his armor, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] heads out for a walk and inspects the rings he took from the mages, and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] heads to his quarters to rest and reflect
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] is troubled by the internal conflict he's experienced recently, as well as his ongoing struggles with connecting to Tymora. He once again hears the voice of the unknown entity from his dream, telling him not to feel guilty for his prior actions
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is quoted a hefty price to repair [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]'s armor that had been split in twain, so he opts to instead sell it as scrap. When he returns, he gives each of his companions a share (5 gold pieces).
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] tries to clear his mind as he fiddles with one of the rings. Putting is on has no effect. Putting on a second causes an echo and shrill feedback in his mind before he rips it off. It appears that he now owns 4 rings of telepathy!
