# Strike From the Shadows
**2024-Jun-01**

- Each of the trio dreams deeply, reliving the attempts to revive Beezer
	- A massive skeletal shadowy claw inserts itself between Beezer's soul and an ethereal underwater light, pulling him away
	- He ends up among a multitude of others in a giant coliseum. An imposing dark form slashes through souls, one by one, with a greatsword. It is very large in stature, taller than any normal human, and its weapon is similarly massive
	- There is a seat of honor in the arena, but it is empty
- Rulkorf tests out his newly-awakened lightning powers, shocking Rowan much more intently than desired. The paladin restores his health
- Kleb improves his rain-catcher a bit on the way
- The group reaches the main camp in the early afternoon. They are received warmly, but the excitement quickly dies down when everyone sees the body of Beezer. Bellamy brings them into a tent where they can place the corpse
	- He is surprised to hear that the Yellyark goblins were in possession of such advanced technology as the Shield Guardian. He thinks it was likely made by some clandestine group using the jungle to do manufacturing and research without being disturbed
	- Bellamy initially feigns ignorance of any candidate actors, but when pressed by Rowan he admits to lying. However, he still resists divulging anything he may know about any blacksite operation, insisting that he believes all the old factories are abandoned
- Bellamy promises to ramp up patrols and seek the party's aid again should more definite problems arise
- There is a big commemorative feast that evening, featuring a number of Chultan jungle delicacies. The atmosphere is slightly somber, given the cost of the rescue operation
	- Kleb uses an open barrel and an expertly-crafted straw to perform a keg stand. Bystanders appreciate his energy and performance, and the mood picks up, but Kleb is disappointed to realize the barrel just had water inside
	- Rowan notices that Bellamy has not eaten or drunk anything. He proposes a toast, and points out the leader's empty cup. The paladin watches him finish his drink
	- Ogden challenges Kleb and Rulkorf to a hot pepper-eating contest, which he wins
- Kleb hits on the same mage as earlier, and is banished for 55 seconds. He is entirely unaware of how close he came to being permanently banished
- The party retires to a shared tent and all fall asleep. Kleb, excessively hydrated, wakes up to pee. He thinks the rain has stopped, but immediately realizes that it is actually still falling and the tent has been blanketed by magical silence
	- He grabs weapons and nudges Eugene awake, only to witness a black cloaked figure stab Rulkorf in the throat. In a blur, the assassin stabs the dwarf three more times, dealing mortal damage.
	- Kleb realizes these are the same group of assassins that attacked the party in Waterdeep, and nearly killed them all then
	- He, Eugene, and Rowan are similarly attacked, but are comparatively unharmed. Rowan feels around for his bag, grabs one of the green pods he foraged from the jungle earlier, and shoves it in his assailant's mouth
	- Kleb needs to wind up in the close quarters, but once he gets a rhythm the fighter starts unleashing a barrage on his attacker. Eugene not only disarms his attacker, but also grapples and bludgeons him with an elbow to the face
- Rowan and Kleb suffer further injuries, but the paladin manages to reach Rulkorf and heal him back from the brink of death.
- Kleb hands Eugene his longsword, then turns back to his attacker and deals a crushing blow with the warhammer. It is not quite fatal, but the man definitely regrets this mission
- Rulkorf tries to blast his assailant with a ice shard, but the target dodges both the projectile and ensuing explosion. With a wind-amplified leap, the dwarf puts some space between himself and the hostiles
- Eugene finishes off one poor soul and does an old man stretch. The remaining assassins down Rowan, which inspires Kleb to truck Rulkorf's attacker as a form of interference. This allows Rulkorf to get to Rowan and feed him a health potion before grabbing his shield and staff
- Eugene slays another assassin in the blink of an eye. Rowan strikes the man in front of him with a powerful rocket-assisted smite, but loses his grip on the sword
- Kleb removes the thrown dagger which struck him earlier from his back, and uses it to attack one of the assassins. A follow-up swing of the warhammer dispatches him entirely
- With a savage clawed hand, Rulkorf rips the heart out of the last enemy. As it sizzles from the acid, the silence spell drops, and the party can hear the sounds of a roaring fire and screams outside
