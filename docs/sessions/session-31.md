# A Foot in the Door
**2023-Feb-26**

- [[the-party|The party]] has one day of prep before things go down
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] rent a cart + horses under pseudonyms (Chagglehorn Smithery & Nereus)
		- 6 gold total, including some extra for the merchant's discretion
		- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] sets up some Hallucinatory Terrain for the getaway cart near the manor
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] hangs out at the local apothecary that Lady Cirilla Avorio is known to frequent. [[fallon|Fallon]] described the Avorio crest as having three prongs and the chimeric heads of a goat, lion, and snake, so [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] looks out for a blond woman with that symbol
		- He accidentally-on-purpose bumps into Madam Avorio, striking up a conversation about useful herbs for shrinking his magnum dong. Crub Hengerson, gentleman athlete, manages to secure an invitation to her dinner party
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] picks up a set of three garnet-inset platinum rings at 50 gp each, to use for magical shenanigans later
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s bros help him get fancied up, and he heads to the manor alone so he can call on Cirilla (and do some recon)
	- The pair settle in to the sitting room by the fireplace, and she charms him (both emotionally and magically). She explains that the mixer tomorrow is for up-and-coming merchants and traders in the local scene
	- Crub offers to bring two of his friends in the ball bearing business tomorrow. Given the recent fortunes that have been made in that industry, Lady Avorio is happy to accept
	- Being left to his own devices, Crub drinks his invisibility potion so he can sneak up to the second floor and take a look around. He investigates the lock sealing the entrance to the Treasury Demiplane, which takes the form of a series of gold rings built into a mural on the wall. He also notices a conspicuous crystal on the wall.
	- The rings have a series of letters on them:
	 > Outer Ring: D SYF ZVMFJY EFEBOX
			Middle Ring: OZD FCWLT VZZD
			Inner Ring: WYEC WYDCC GUZ GK

	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] avoids a trio of patrolling guards by hovering with his broom, but his investigations don't yield much else of note. He waits until he turns visible again to leave, so that his exit is seen by others
	- The next morning, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] and [[fallon|Fallon]] buy a second, fancier carriage to use for the proper entrance. Ahead of the event, [[fallon|Fallon]] stashes the jankier cart behind the camouflage that the dwarf created
- Go Time
	- [[the-party|The party]] is going to enter as guests, smuggling the thieves past the wall in the carriage with [[fallon|Fallon]] as their driver and footman
		- The thieves are very standoffish and dressed uniformly in black
	- The trio pass the guards' inspection and make their way inside, where they meet the butler in the foyer
	- [[fallon|Fallon]] parks the cart and the thieves slip away to do their own mission
