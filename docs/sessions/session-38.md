# The Great Library
**2023-Jun-25**

- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] finds an artisanal glass shop, of all things, that is willing to sell him another Necklace of Fireballs. Meanwhile, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] purchases an ornate silver basin to be a vessel for future scrying. It is ringed with sigils and sagas praising Valkur, the god of storms and sailors. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] picks up some thieves tools and lockpicks, in addition to a forgery kit
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] also patronizes a fletchery shop and gets two of his beads set into crossbow bolts. He makes a point of neither threatening nor shaking down the merchant, despite possible appearance of the contrary
		- When he picks up the bolts that evening, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] of course gives him a pamphlet (and a pep talk)
	- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] similarly acquires a new cart since the old one was quite damaged -- this new one is tricked out, with aftermarket rims, a (singing stone) sound system, decals, a spoiler, and fashionable traces of damage
		- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] bonds with a cool guy named Ronald over their shared love of lowrider carts, and Ronald hooks him up with some LEDs and horse-headlamp-high-beams for free
- With gear packed and a pimped out ride, [[the-party|the party]] sets out for Candlekeep in the morning, leaving [[fallon|Fallon]] to his gig in the city (he's going to head back to [[phandalin|Phandalin]] soon)
- The ride on the Coast Way is uneventful, and before long the looming spires of Candlekeep appear before the trio. A sea of tents surround the path towards the monastery, as if it were under siege, and the road is open but crowded
	- [[the-party|The party]] parks their cart, stabling the horses for free, and slowly make their way to the gate. They present to the ticket-taker elf
		1. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s hand-written pamphlet detailing [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]] doctrine
		2. Captain's log from the Thunderbird
		3. The spellbook of Zarathustra
	- She takes the materials and puts them in a delivery chute, and hands out library cards to [[the-party|the party]]
	- The elf's special glasses also show her that [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] has a hit out on him, but she can't see details. She assures him that he will be safe inside the keep
- Having been granted access, [[the-party|the party]] pushes through the throngs in the courtyard and are met by a member of the Avowed, dressed in yellow robes of the god Oghma. [[the-party|The party]] members are considered Seekers, and are not allowed past the Pillars of Pedagogy, through the Emerald Door, or into the stacks in the keep proper.
	- The amenities in the courtyard include an inn, bathhouse, and dining hall
