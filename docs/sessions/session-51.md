# The Ship is Going Down
**2024-Jan-06**

- *In-person session in Cambridge!*

---
- Rowan realizes he is kinda useless at range. He looks at the shield generator control panel but gets intimidated by the shield runes and gives up immediately
	- 6 runes on control panel, one of which is flickering. Rulkorf recognizes it as a stability rune but doesn't know how to interact with it
- The dwarf sends a large wave which carries three of the five boats out ahead in a pile, but fails to capsize any of them. He follows it up with River: Become Trench, dropping three boats into a watery pit
- One boat pulls close and tosses grappling hooks over the railing. Kleb shoots an explosive arrow at it but one occupant catches it and throws the arrow back, causing a large explosion and some damage to the casino boat
- Four pirates board the casino boat and split into pairs. One group heads towards the stern while the others charge Rowan. A fifth member stays behind in the boarding boat
- Kleb is struck by a dart in addition to his own arrow that gets thrown back at him
	- Vehemently refusing to learn his lesson, Kleb shoots another arrow, but this one is a harpoon. When the pirate again snatches it out of the air, he gets pulled overboard
- Rowan and Rulkorf are both assaulted by pirates, and end up stunned and taking a solid beating, respectively
- Kleb trades darts with the second boarding party as Rowan uses his spiritual sword to swipe at his assailants
- Tattooed pirate is excited to face a worthy opponent, squares off against the toad and blasts him with water, to little effect. Kleb is struck by a similar effect from a magical tattoo but with lightning instead
- The giant toad and paladin crush one enemy, but the other one grapples Rowan. He fails to toss Rowan through the railing, and the two duel each other
- Kleb reels in his taut harpoon line and pulls up some sort of giant mudskipper river monster. The boat is starting to list precariously and is taking on water belowdecks
- Rowan jumps overboard and activates the foldable boat, but fails to account for the time it takes to open. He hits the water first, then the boat unfolds above him
- Kleb also realizes it's time to go and mounts his broom. Rulkorf drops toad form, casts Water Walk to save Rowan, and then jumps overboard. He misjudges the distance though and hits the boat instead of the water
- Kleb realizes that Beezer is missing, and flies back inside the hole in the ship to search for him. In Beezer's bunk, he finds a note that simply reads "Gone Gambling." Kleb heads to the casino as the boat begins sinking faster
- Rowan and Rulkorf lash their foldable boat to one of the empty pirate vessels, and the paladin guides a couple members of the Order of the Gauntlet to safety. He also tries to magically locate the ceremonial dagger that Beezer had been carrying but fails. This is actually useful information though, as the only reason it could fail is some amount of lead in between the caster and target, which means Beezer must be in the vault
- Kleb flies in to rescue him, and makes it into the vault, but loses his grip on the broom. Rulkorf rushes in afterwards to help but has trouble getting past the mudskipper which is rampaging through the casino. Eventually Kleb flies up the spiral staircase to make his escape but the mudskipper traps the back of the broom in its jaws
- Kleb blows another hole in the side of the casino and the mudskipper decides to leave
- The party collects survivors floating in the water, including Lt. Hale, four of his comrades, and an old man named Eugene who survived fighting with the sea monster
- All head towards the shore in the pair of boats. Beezer reveals that he managed to grab a platinum bar from inside the vault
