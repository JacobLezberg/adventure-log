# A Somber March
**2024-Apr-19**

- The party tries to loot the shield guardian, but none of them have the aptitude to salvage much besides the helmet spike
	- Kleb slaps Ogden the kenku, shoves one of the ex-prisoners, and stomps off into the forest
- They carry Beezer's body out of the clearing and the whole group heads back to the village, freed hostages in tow
	- The half-orc asks for salt, cloth, and a couple copper pieces, and performs a simple spell to preserve the body (Gentle Repose, lasts 10 days)
- Eventually the group is forced to make camp for the night. Kleb apologizes to Ogden, and the others give him a respectful berth
	- The ex-prisoners consist of 3 human commoners, an elven ranger, and the half-orc cleric
	- Kleb, Rowan, and Rulkorf have a bit of a heart-to-heart. Kleb never felt the cost of battle this way before
	- The party is determined now to not only find the Soulmonger, but repair things in time to Revivify Beezer. They plan to leave the corpse in the village with the cleric in the meantime
	- The night passes without incident
