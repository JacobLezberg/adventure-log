# Big City Life
**2022-Nov-13**

- [[the-party|The party]] "winds down" with a tailgate at their wagon, which is sparsely attended
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] jumps through a cart just for the fun of it
- After a night's sleep, they continue traveling and soon leave the carnival behind
	- Realizing that Candlekeep would take a couple months of travel overland, the trio decide to journey by sea instead. They settle on riding to [[Neverwinter]] first and chartering passage on boat from there
- While they move up the High Road, a column of knights approach, heading southward
	- Most are in grey, some in yellow, and all have an insignia of a broadsword on their chests. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] recognizes them as belonging to the order of Tyr (the god of justice)
	- The yellow-clad paladins leading the formation are "Justices" who have authority both in religious duties and martial affairs
	- One of the rearguard justices warns [[the-party|the party]] that they are traveling "in the wrong direction," but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] insults him so they don't converse any further
- A few days later, the group reaches the city of [[Neverwinter]] and follows the flow of people toward the markets
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] contemplates buying a "Winter? Not Even Once" shirt but decides against it due to the high price
- The first order of business is lodging, which [[the-party|the party]] secures at the Umber Hulk's Shell
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] pays extra for a room for himself. The others opt for simple bunks in the communal area
	- They break for their individual goals, agreeing to reconvene at dusk
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] heads to the Beached Leviathan, a party boat moored at the [[Neverwinter]] docks that functions as a tavern
	- He has little luck getting an in with anyone there and decides to stroll down to the docks themselves
	- A water genasi is stationed at the harbormaster's quarters,. He is very confused and hard of hearing, but after a small bribe he tells [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] about two ships heading to Baldur's Gate soon: The Oremaster and The Silent Knight
	- Hoping the Oremaster might have a dwarven crew that could be more sympathetic to him, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] goes to find it
	- The captain is named Alabaster, and although he is not a dwarf, agrees to provide passage to [[the-party|the party]] in exchange for their assistance as crew members. The ship leaves at Godswake in two days time
- [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] goes shopping at an armory, The Last Dagger. He explains his desire for a more lethal weapon to the rock gnome at the counter, who procures an array of morningstars and longswords
	- The magic swords feature an ice enchantment, an infusion of lightning, and a "rockette" blade that can be fired with a button press, respectively
	- The paladin trades his mace (and 25 gold) for the rocket sword (with 30 day warranty)
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] goes up to the prporietor of the Umber Hulk's Shell and inquires about local printing presses and women of low standards
	- He recommends the Chasm District and the Moonstone Mask for each of those objectives
	- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] finds a print shop called "Pressing Matters" in the Chasm District that makes designs for shirts and tunics and pays them to print copies of his newest "[[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] attack ad" pamphlet
		- The owner, Branklin, is strongly anti-establishment and sympathetic to what [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is trying to do
		- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] buys 150 copies at 6 copper each (9 gold total), and Franklin also quotes him a price for posters in the future (and puts him in touch with a friend and contact named Guillermo). 4 gold are a deposit, with the rest due on completion
	- On a message board in town, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] sees a Lozenge Gule post denouncing the city watch's un-chad-ness and a general invitation to fight the author. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] posts a response accepting the duel
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] also buys Navigator's tools and Mason's tools
