# Schemes & Maneuvers
**2022-Jun-05**

The crew settle at a table in the Stonehill Inn with [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] to draft a plan to drive them out of [[phandalin|Phandalin]]. It quickly escalates from pranks to all-out psychogical warfare, at which point [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] voices his hesitation to transgress against the Lords' Alliance. He is honorbound to act prudently, but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] has taken no such oath. The latter spots a [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] member across the hall and, without hesitation, throws his earthenware mug at the robed man. It strikes him in the back of the head with a resounding *thunk* and the missionary drop unconscious.

Somewhat used to Kleb's whims, the rest of the party quickly agrees to drag the body out behind the inn. Kleb takes the man's coinpurse and tosses it to the bartender, who agrees to keep quiet about the incident. Rowan steals his robes, and Kleb decides the man deserves more humiliation. The fighter graffitis him with dicks (as is ritually done to the unconscious in accordance with Lozenge Gules), dunks him in a manure pit,  and finally tosses him (with Rowan's help) in front of Barthen's store.

Deciding the [[nothic|Nothic]] might be useful, the party heads up to Tresendar Manor. They find the door locked, but Kleb uses his keyring to eventually open the door. They decide to explore the northern section of the hideout under the manor, where Rulkorf nearly falls into a spike trap. He noticed it, but thought he could jump over it -- instead, he slipped and nearly impaled himself, but managed to cross the gap with some clever use of a handheld mirror and a timely *Misty Step*. 

- talks to Jeeves with Rowan
- Kleb nopes out
- Rowan and Rulkorf discover a pair of empty prison cells off the crypt
- Kleb talks to Nothic, discovers org has grown but most members are out
- R&R come to a locked iron door, decide easiest course of action is to just get the key from Kleb. Rulkorf opens the secret door and calls out to Kleb in the large cavern, who rejoins them and opens the iron door
- They enter a workshop. Not much inside besides Redbrand cloaks and random weapons, but Kleb notices some tools for enhancing weapons
- Rulkorf leaves his extra spellbooks for the Nothic, and introduces him to Gil
- Kleb instructs Dennis, a Redbrand homebody who is holding down the fort, to watch out for the Lozenge Azure
- The party ask the Nothic to harass the Lozenge Azure and help drive them out of town. He agrees, and also provides a shortlist of the semi-interesting rumors and secrets he's discovered recently. Specifically,
	1. Increase in traffic at Candlekeep
	2. Traveling circus on the road between Phandalin and Neverwinter
	3. Increase in outbound charters from Waterdeep
- The group heads out via the central tunnel that they had previously ignored, which eventually takes them aboveground to the north of town
- On their way back to the inn, Kleb practices with his broom to try and control his speed more reliably. They agree to meet with Garaele (and maybe Halia in the morning), and head to bed

Kleb does his morning exercises on the town green again while waiting for the others to wake up, but eventually they meet outside Garaele's house. She invites them in and gives Rulkorf and Rowan their newly-minted Harpers' Medallions. They briefly discuss the Lozenge Azure before Garaele returns to the matter of their earlier mission for her with Agatha. Rowan recounts the information they learned, which pleases Garaele.

For Rulkorf and Rowan, the reward is satisfaction and gratitude from the Harper's organization. As an independent contractor, Kleb is owed 5 GP, which Garaele gives to Rulkorf (as Kleb left the earlier when Sister Garaele scolded him for eating all of her cookies). Upon receiving his reward, Kleb flips each of his partners 1 gold piece in thanks.
