# Schemes & Maneuvers

**2022-Jun-05**

The crew settle at a table in the Stonehill Inn with [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] to draft a plan to drive the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] out of [[phandalin|Phandalin]]. It quickly escalates from pranks to all-out psychogical warfare, at which point [[sildar-hallwinter|Sildar]] voices his hesitation to transgress against the Lords' Alliance. He is honorbound to act prudently, but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] has taken no such oath. The latter spots a [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] member across the hall and, without hesitation, throws his earthenware mug at the robed man. It strikes him in the back of the head with a resounding *thunk* and the missionary drop unconscious.

Somewhat used to [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s whims, the rest of [[the-party|the party]] quickly agrees to drag the body out behind the inn. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] takes the man's coinpurse and tosses it to the bartender, who agrees to keep quiet about the incident. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] steals his robes, and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] decides the man deserves more humiliation. The fighter graffitis him with dicks (as is ritually done to the unconscious in accordance with [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]]), dunks him in a manure pit,  and finally tosses him (with [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s help) in front of Barthen's store.

Deciding the [[nothic|Nothic]] might be useful, [[the-party|the party]] heads up to [[tresendar-manor|Tresendar Manor]]. They find the door locked, but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] uses his keyring to eventually open the door. They decide to explore the northern section of the hideout under the manor, where [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] nearly falls into a spike trap. He noticed it, but thought he could jump over it -- instead, he slipped and nearly impaled himself, but managed to cross the gap with some clever use of a handheld mirror and a timely *Misty Step*.

- As the group comes upon Jeeves, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] takes the opportunity to nope out of there. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] talk to the servant and discover a pair of empty prison cells off the crypt
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] talks to [[nothic|Nothic]], discovers that the organization has grown but most members are out
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] leaves his extra spellbooks for the [[nothic|Nothic]], and introduces him to [[gil|Gil]]
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] instructs Dennis, a Redbrand homebody who is holding down the fort, to watch out for the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]
- Reuniting, the group opens a locked iron door with [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s key and enter what appears to be a workshop. Not much inside besides Redbrand cloaks and random equipment, but [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] notices some tools for enhancing weapons
- [[the-party|The party]] ask the [[nothic|Nothic]] to harass the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] and help drive them out of town. He agrees, and also provides a shortlist of the semi-interesting rumors and secrets he's discovered recently. Specifically,

 1. Increase in traffic at Candlekeep
 2. Traveling circus on the road between [[phandalin|Phandalin]] and [[Neverwinter]]
 3. Increase in outbound charters from [[Waterdeep]]

- The group heads out via the central tunnel that they had previously ignored, which eventually takes them aboveground to the north of town
- On their way back to the inn, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] practices with his broom to try and control his speed more reliably. They agree to meet with [[sister-garaele|Garaele]] (and maybe Halia in the morning), and head to bed

[[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] does his morning exercises on the town green again while waiting for the others to wake up, but eventually they meet outside [[sister-garaele|Garaele]]'s house. She invites them in and gives [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] their newly-minted [[harpers|Harpers]]' Medallions. They briefly discuss the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] before [[sister-garaele|Garaele]] returns to the matter of their earlier mission for her with [[agatha|Agatha]]. [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] recounts the information they learned, which pleases [[sister-garaele|Garaele]].

For [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]], the reward is satisfaction and gratitude from the Harper's organization. As an independent contractor, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is owed 5 GP, which [[sister-garaele|Garaele]] gives to [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] (as [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] left the earlier when [[sister-garaele|Sister Garaele]] scolded him for eating all of her cookies). Upon receiving his reward, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] flips each of his partners 1 gold piece in thanks.
