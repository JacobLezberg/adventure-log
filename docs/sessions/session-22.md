# The Errant and Their Errands

**2022-Nov-20**

- In the evening, [[the-party|the party]] decides to pregame at the Umber Hulk's Shell before heading out to the town
  - They start with a game of Beirut/Beer Pong/Beerdeep
    - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] recruits a halfling from the tavern to be his partner and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] partners with [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]
    - The paladin/druid combo emerge victorious
  - Shots shots shots
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] freshens up and the trio make their way to the Moonstone Mask, a premier floating club over the water
- The bouncer, an earth elemental, charges a cover of 1 platinum
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] pays the fee but [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] and [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] want to find another way in (the former because he's cheap and the latter because he's underage)
    - The pair hop on [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s broom, and under the cover of a *Pass without Trace*, manage to land on the second-floor balcony
    - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] uses [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s magical stamp as a template and imitates it with his quill and ink on the back of his own hand (and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s)
    - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] also received a slim masquerade mask when he entered, which the others don't have. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] scrounges a discarded one for himself and convinces a guy in the bathroom to sell [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] his mask
- The boys hit the dance floor
  - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] shares his smuggled-in alcohol and mingles, keeping everyone topped up
  - [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] turns into a crab and raves. The DJ loves it and starts transmogrifying people as they get into it
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] chats up a girl and is led upstairs. He is super excited until he notices a pentagram drawn in blood on the floor of the bedroom
    - The girl closes the door behind [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] as he sees a bald figure in red robes with a symbol drawn on his forehead. The man magically paralyses [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]
    - The pentagram begins to glow as the robed man raises his hand and the cultist girl draws a dagger. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] manages to escape the hold and turns the dagger back on its wielder, stabbing her once and then throwing it at the man (but missing)
    - After a chance to draw his weapons, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] makes short work of his assailants, tossing them both out the window of this room into the ocean
    - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] returns to the main floor to find Rulkrab dancing on [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]]'s shoulders and rejoins [[the-party|the party]]
- As the crowd eventually clears out and [[the-party|the party]] dies down, [[the-party|the party]] make their way down the gangplank and back to the Umber Hulk's Shell. They settle in for the night and get some rest
- In the morning, on a recommendation from the innkeeper, the trio checks out a set of shops that sell weapons, armor, and scrolls
  - At *Whap, Smack, and Clobber: Smiths at Forge*, a broad selection of bludgeoning implements greet [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]. He ultimately selects Doorknocker, a +1 warhammer with the ability to cast *Knock* once per day, trading in both [[toby-keith-blackbird|TK]]'s magic shortsword and his current warhammer
  - At *Ranger Equipment Incorporated*, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] tries on a set of enchanted ironwood (equivalent to a steel breastplate) but can't afford to upgrade quite yet. Damn vegan ranger hippies driving up the price of all the druid gear
    - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] talks to the workers about the corporate structure of their collective and piques his interest in eventually transitioning to a workers' co-op
  - At the *Scrolls on 8th*, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] digs around in the bargain bin, hoping to get a  steal. He pays 5 gold for an offensive scroll, which turns out to be a copy of *Circle of Death*. It appears to have a defect related to its maximum range (hence the discount), but it is not clear how that works specifically
    - [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] does similarly, looking for a utility spell. Tymora guides his hand to some type of enchantment spell, which appears to be a scroll of *Modify Memory*
- The group walk over to *Pressing Matters*, the print shop, to see the state of [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]]'s pamphlet order. 250 brand new pamphlets are ready for distribution and payment is rendered.
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] hands some of them back to the proprietor and gives him some silver, encouraging him to spread them locally after [[the-party|the party]] leaves town.
  - Branklin seems to have genuinely bought in to the [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]] philosophy and happily agrees. [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] takes his half of the reading materials and begins posting and distributing them himself
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] goes to the house of his fellow [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]]' member to fight him, but finds only a burnt-out shell of a house with a note asserting his stupidity for expecting the challenge to be so straightforward
  - [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] leaves a note in reply (Too small to fight me? No balls.) and hides, waiting for the man to take the bait
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] meanders around the city exploring a bit and looking for an establishment that might be able to inspect his lantern. He isn't satisfied with anything he comes across, so the druid eventually heads out beyond the city wall
  - Follow markings in Druidic, [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] makes his way to a hilltop north of [[neverwinter|Neverwinter]], which is an earthmoat that serves as a gathering place for druids
  - He meditates and notices that the lantern is significantly dimmer. The dwarf can still feel presence of the spirit inside but doesn't get any reply to his attempts at communication
  - After some time, another druid approaches -- They are a wood elf in a green-leaf cloak that [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] recognizes. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] is familiar with this elf named Match, and the two share a quiet respect
    - They wordlessly commune with the natural landscape together, fostering healthy wildlife and encouraging the nearby plants to grow strong. By the time they finish their ritual, it is fairly late, and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] heads back into [[neverwinter|Neverwinter]]
