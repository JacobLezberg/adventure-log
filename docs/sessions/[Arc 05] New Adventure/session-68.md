# Vibe Check
**2025-Jun-20**

- The "Vibe" room is next, which teleports the party to a long stone bridge
	- A knight stands before them, in shining armor with colorful epaulettes
	- The knight casts a Zone of Truth and demands they each name 5 brothers. Only Kleb responds satisfactorily and is approved to pass
	- As he passes, Kleb notices a pin of the Argentine Brotherhood adorning the knight's cloak
	- They agree on honorable combat anyway, to help the brother out of his funk
		- The magical stone boombox starts playing as they engage each other
	- Kleb sets him on fire, the knight blinds the fighter
	- Rowan dispels the music magically, but the knight blames it on Rulkorf as the dwarf was in his line of sight inspecting (and failing to manipulate) the boombox
	- The druid trades lightning bolts with greatsword slashes, but magical interference distorts his magic
		- A burst of wild magic allows him to see invisible creatures, which reveals a large horse hanging out on the bridge
		- Kleb tries to find it, and gets hit by a hoof. He miraculously manages to tame it by making it feel seen in a way it rarely has experienced
	- Eugene squares up, blade ready, but Rulkorf instructs him to hold. Honor demands the combat remain solo
	- Rulkorf is struck and sent flying back into the stone wall of the bridge. It is visibly weakened, with cracks webbing out from the impact point
	- As the druid's thorn whip wraps around the knight, Rulkorf steps aside, pulling him through through the compromised wall
		- The knight salutes as he falls, grateful to be relieved of his duty at last
- The part grabs the key floating at the far end of the bridge. When they return to the mansion room, Kleb is still atop his invisible horse
	- Rulkorf also finds a miniature version of the magic boombox in his pouch. It is a stone Walkman, which when activated (bonus action) gives Bless on the user
