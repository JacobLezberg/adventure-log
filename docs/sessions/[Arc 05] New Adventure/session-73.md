# Episode Title
**2025-Oct-29**

- The party makes their way around the lingering flames from Kleb's fireball bead and confirm that the Squash and Swat rooms appear empty and unremarkable
	- The squash was ostensibly the Headless Horseman's head
	- The SWAT team was the crossbow-wielding dwarves, whose corpses have Goggles of the Night Owl (like Rowan's) as well as mithril armor and grenades
		- Rulkorf refuses to don the dwarf-sized armor based on his druidic commitments, but carries the suits just so his enemies know he could be even stronger if he wanted
- The drink room contains nothing notable except a half full glass of sand that was knocked over
	- Looking into the room makes it hard to focus one's eyes, as though everything were slightly out of focus. Rowan is not able to detect any magic
- Kleb, investigating the squash room again, notices the color and texture draining out of his surroundings. The party agrees that it is time to get into the Locked Room at the end of the hall and get out of the manor ASAP
- As Rulkorf pulls the first key out of the bag of holding, the other keys rise up and meld into the first, and the doors transfigures through facades representing each chamber.
	- The final door is wide, black, and wood-slatted, with the keyhole on the left side. The dwarf inserts the master key into this door
	- A closed fist comes out of the door in place of a doorknob. Unable to progress by fist-bumping or pulling it, Kleb uses his hammer to Knock on the door
	- The hand opens and the black surface of the door becomes a painted scene of a dwarven skeleton warrior. Once Kleb shakes its hand, the door dematerializes from a painting into a doorway
		- Shocked at the undead contact, Kleb yanks his hand away reflexively and the painting reforms
	- With the help of Rowan's Heroism spell, Kleb shakes the hand firmly and steps inside. The dwarf collapses into a pile of bones and the door reforms behind him. Inside, he sees a painting showing the party, and a number of trinkets scattered around the room, as well as the dwarf's stuff
		- Notably, the latter include a tower shield, magic circlet, and fearsome sword, and the trinkets as well as a battered set of bronze plate, a worn coin, a +1 mace, 10 feet of string, 3 candles, a piece of glass, a brown pouch, a talisman featuring a figure with folded arms, a cloak that billows without wind, a pouch of dust, and a wand with multiple removable parts
		- There is also a key with a note tied onto it, which reads "House Key: Do Not Lose."
	- From Rowan and Rulkorf's perspective, Kleb is now in the painting and his closed fist is protruding as the doorknob. Rulkorf unfurls the fist by beating it at rock-paper-scissors, then shakes Kleb's hand and pulls him out
		- Once they release hands, the door turns back into something inert
- Rulkorf and Kleb stuff their loot into the bag of holding, while Rowan goes to insert the house key into the lock
	- The door shapeshifts into a large wooden door that Rulkorf remembers to be modeled after the front door of the manor
- Kleb smashes one last window, just for fun, and then the party uses the key and is teleported back to the riverbank of Chult at last
- The druid notices the village has essentially disappeared, with only a few scattered posts and remnants of structures in the clearing
	- It has been roughly 3 days since the party left, according to their internal clocks. Evidently much more time has passed
	- Kleb takes to the broom to scout, and sees the damage to the village footprint and nearby jungle is severe, with obvious signs of struggle but no dead bodies
- Wolfkorf can't pick up the scent of any villagers, or smoke and ash lingering in the air. The smells seem much older than expected. Rowan tries to Locate the Object that is Beezer's corpse, which fails
	- There are no boats left, or any debris on the riverbank. Rulkorf suspects they packed things up thoroughly, but Kleb notices personal belongings left behind and theorizes a more rushed escape
	- Under an overturned pot, Kleb finds a holy symbol of Selune, which is inscribed with a message of dedication to its owner for their promotion to priesthood. He is visibly shaken by his deductions of what happened here
		- Among other findings, Kleb notices two coins half-buried in mud in the shadow of what used to be the longhouse where Beezer's body was kept. He takes the coins but keeps this information to himself
- Kleb's jar of coins has a 41/9/2 split of copper/silver/gold
- The party decides to take a pair of 2-man watches and camp on the bank for the night. When awake, each spends time looking over their new loot
	- The Shield of Stop has a dial that can be tuned to any damage type and offers resistance to that type. It also has a button which when clicked gives the shield the properties of an immovable rod
	- Circlet of Deterministic Spellcasting offers the ability to concentrate on a second spell
	- Sword of Choicest Combat is a magical +2 longsword with two dials on the pommel, one for physical damage types and the other for special types. It can identify the type weaknesses of the last creature it struck
	- The trinkets are identified as
		- Dust of Sneezing
		- Cloak of Billowing (for dramatic effect)
		- Talisman of Dragon Detection (identifies dragon or not-dragon)
		- Bag of Tricks (summon a random monster from a d8 table 3 times per day)
		- Burglar's Mirror (piece of glass but when attuned, acts as a mirror for the user)
		- Candles of the Jack-o-Lantern (3 candles that give the user the properties of a construct for 10 minutes)
		- Wand of Wonder (lots of effects, must be attuned)
		- Unbreakable String (10 feet of unbreakable string)
		- A worn gold coin, mundane bronze plate and a +1 mace
	- Rowan tries to trick the dragon talisman with a respectable-quality drawing he made, and it correctly discerns that this is not a dragon
	- Kleb swaps out his [[Calibur]] for the Sword of Choicest Combat, Rowan takes up the Shield of Stop and also puts his old shield in the Bag of Holding, and Rulkorf dons the circlet
	- Rowan takes the cloak and the coin, rubbing it together with his lucky Tymora coin
	- Each of the trio take a Jack-o-Candle and the rest is to be determined later
- Level up!
