# Past Trauma
**2025-Mar-14**

- Horror Room
	- A wild intro physics problem set appeared. Emotional damage, psychic damage, PTSD, all at once.
	- 6/7 right is good enough for a key!
- Upon reappearing in the mansion, the party notices a faint shimmer on their primary weapons. They gain +1 permanently!
- One of the desks begins to tremble, and in front of Rulkorf the desk surface hinges open as a decaying hand grabs onto the lip to pull itself up
	- The dwarf's attempts to stuff it back where it came from fail, as it turns to smoke and rematerializes at will
	- The doors slam shut and the temperature in the room drops sharply, freezing the sweat upon their brows. Rowan ignites his sword with both mundane and holy fire, slashing through the wraith-like figure twice as he flails wildly
	- Kleb throws a homemade molotov at the desk, igniting it and nearly taking Rulkorf along with it. Rowan is covered in flames but enthusiastically encouraging Kleb
		- The fighter takes a beat to make a more measured assessment of the creature, concluding that it is probably a rare type of undead that is resistant to most elements
	- The creatures speaks in breathy whispers that stab into the minds of those that hear it. Kleb's vision dims and is struck by a splitting headache. He instinctually swings at the creature but attacks Rulkorf instead in his confusion, missing because he thinks he is attacking someone of much greater stature
	- Rulkorf tries to strip the creature of some of its elemental resistance, but it shrugs off the magic. Rowan creates a spell circle covering most of the room, trapping the creature and insulating the party from being charmed or possessed
	- Kleb lands a couple solid blows but in his frenzy jams his sword between the lid and body of the desk. He manages to wrench it back, and notices the rune on its flat has changed from Exossis to Exlignum. With one final attack, Kleb vanquishes the creature and sends it back into the desk
- Rowan tries to repoen the lid of the desk immediately, taking psychic damage from contact with the hand that shoots out before Kleb chops it off
- The party is not aware, but Kleb is hit by some sort of energy blast right at the end of the encounter
