# A Beast of a Problem
**2024-Feb-17**

- As the T-Rex lumbers towards the group, Kleb hops on his broom and flies up to intercept the beast. He narrowly avoids some very sharp teeth, with only the tip of the broom getting bitten off
	- Kleb hops onto the creature's back, and despite losing his footing, hangs onto its neck
- Rowan strengthens his conquering aura, striking fear into the heart of the beast and stopping it dead in its tracks. Kleb tries to assert dominance over the dinosaur but can't communicate with it well enough to accomplish much
- Rulkorf turns into a horse, picks up Eugene, and runs away with Beezer in tow. He tries to get the other dwarf on his back as well, but only succeeds in bowling him over. Trying to offset his cowardice, Rulkorf turns back to help Beezer back onto his feet, and then onto horseback
- Rowan turns to run as well, and eventually Kleb slides off the dinosaur's back. Once he's hanging from his broom, however, he poses a very enticing morsel for the beast, and Kleb is captured in its jaws
- An emergency *Command* on the paladin's part forces the T-Rex to drop Kleb, and Rulkorf ferries his cargo all the way to Hercules, who has formed up with his comrades
- Kleb and Rowan manage to separate from the creature, and everyone regroups by the boats. Kleb managed to pick up a few bananas, but otherwise everyone is empty-handed from the hunt. The whole party hydrates from their individual stone jugs, with purified water
	- Kleb is provided some divine field medicine before performing overwatch for the boats as they head back out on the water. He spots some fish in the river and spears 6 of them. Rulkorf is inspired and decides to use his fishing rod, hauling in another 8. Everyone in the group gets to eat fish for dinner
- The boats travel about 20 miles total for the day, reaching the border between hexes 3428 and 3429
- The group makes camp right on the shore, cooking a basic dinner and planning to stave off exhaustion with a solid night's sleep
	- Eugene provides a song of rest, and Kleb/Beezer take first watch shift. A bunch of axe-beaks (big birds) approach them cautiously, but depart without incident
	- Rowan and Rulkorf take the second watch. Rowan wanders a bit and finds a crocodile, but resists antagonizing it. A mango falls in front of Rulkorf, which he picks up to inspect. As he gets pulled up into the trees, it becomes clear that the fruit was bait for a trap
