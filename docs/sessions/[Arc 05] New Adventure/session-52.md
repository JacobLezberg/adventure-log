# Danger at Every Turn
**2024-Feb-09**

- Beezer, Lt. Hale, 4 Order of the Gauntlet initiates (Hercules Cross, Experience Cuppage, Increase Thorpe, and Jesus Christ), Eugene, and the party trio find themselves on the left bank of the river Soshenstar. They take stock of their rations and do a bit of scouting
- The extended party takes the two boats upriver, not too far from shore, sleeping in shifts. They spend some time figuring out how to obtain enough potable water each day, settling on creating a bunch of stone vessels so they can hold up to 15 gallons
- Rowan, Kleb, and three soldiers take first shift. Beezer, Eugene, and Lt. Hale are on second shift. The group reaches map hex 3628 without incident
- On the shore in the morning, the Gauntlet soldiers form a hunting party while the trio, Beezer, and Eugene do some foraging, water purifying, and vessel-shaping
	- Kleb keeps winking at nearby trees after every innuendo. No dryads appear
- Rowan gets tangled up in some predatory vines, but manages to cut himself out
	- Just as he escapes, Rulkorf, Beezer, and Eugene become restrained
	- Kleb rescues the druid, who takes a moment to speak with the plants. He locates the "assassin vines." They want restitution for being slashed, and Rulkorf fails to persuade them to leave the group alone. He does release Eugene
	- Eugene, with his footing regained, rips the vines off of Beezer. The sorcerer looses a firebolt and retreats back to the boats. The others quickly follow
- After regrouping, they decide to try and find the hunting party. Rowan leads the way, tracking the other group with dubious skill but lots of luck
	- As the party gets close to their comrades, they hear a crash and some swearing. A rampaging Girallon bursts through the undergrowth
	- The party forms up to engage it, and gets a few solid hits in. It's strength is nearly overwhelming, but Kleb holds his own under the onslaught. He and Rowan match its four arms and dispatch the beast, with help from Rulkorf's Faerie Fire
	- They begin to celebrate the efficient battle, but only a few moments later Lt. Hale dashes past them, pursued by something even bigger
