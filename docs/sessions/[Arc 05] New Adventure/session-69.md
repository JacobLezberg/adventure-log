# Hi, My Name Is ☝︎♋︎♌︎♏︎
**2025-Jul-16**

- Acererak checks in on the party's progress. He notes their good progress on collecting keys but mentions that they have yet to meet "Gabe." He can't wait...
- Upon trying to gallop down the hallway, Kleb falls off his invisible horse, spends some time trying to corral it, although he does succeed
- A wave of sickness washes over Rowan, emanating from the nearby staircase. A slow rhythmic thumping noise soon follows the divine sense
	- The presence is evidently that of an 8 ft tall red-eyed mummy wearing a Hawaiian shirt
		- On his shirt is a nametag with hieroglyphs
	- With remote tactical assistance from Kleb, Rulkorf and Rowan quickly settle on trying to push Gabe out the window at the landing of the staircase. The paladin charges and unleashes his divine and thunderous smites, dealing significant damage despite Gabe's apparent resilience against radiance (unlike most undead)
	- The mummy speaks in an ancient unnerving tongue, with an odd bass echoing underneath the words. Rulkorf's mind becomes fuzzy and he stands stupefied with a ringing in his ears
	- Rowan stands tall, and locks eyes with the mummy. Gabe's dreadful glare not only has no effect, but he blinks before the paladin does. Rowan is immune to dreadful glare for 24hrs
	- Kleb tries to return on his horse, but the horse bolts faster and farther than he intended. Rulkorf gets bowled over, but Kleb does manage to loose two crossbow bolts from horseback
	- Gabe unleashes a spell that severely harms and weakens Rowan, lowering his current and total health pool by 50 points. When the paladin tries to retaliate with a shield bash, he is struck in the head by a skeletal fist, and downed
		- Rowan is afflicted with the curse "Mummy Rot," the effects of which will become apparent in two days
	- Rulkorf heals the paladin a bit and then launches himself into the fray. He jumps down the stairs but gets grabbed out of the air when he tries to body slam into Gabe
		- The mummy stifles all further healing within 60ft of himself
	- Kleb overcomes his fear to hop on his broom and fly towards Gabe. He smashes a flask of oil on the mummy's head, then sets it on fire. He follows it up with a warhammer swing that hits Gabe square in the head
		- The mummy uses Rulkorf as a weapon to bludgeon Kleb, then paralyzes the fighter with his piercing gaze
	- Rowan finally slays the hulk with a sword strike right up the body cavity, and Gabe falls apart from the inside before stumbling back out the window
