- Kleb posts a pamphlet on a message board near the harbor, circumventing the magical moderation by tacking it to the wooden frame
- Outside the Temple of Gond, a barker charges two coppers for the chance to view a spectacular creation of Gond. The party pays the fee and heads inside, discovering a steam engine being used to pump water
	- With one of the more charismatic representatives, Rulkorf discusses refining his fulgurite shard. He can return the following day to discuss pricing, but the priests should be able to alter his breastplate to allow the shard to be inset
- When they return to Kaya's, the trio find Beezer recovering from a severe hangover. After copious vomiting and a bit of magical healing, he agrees to lead them to Oz's apartment so they can recover items to help with scrying
	- They know there will be traps that require disengaging so that they can look through his personal effects
	- The bedroom was already unlocked. An axe trap triggers but misses Rowan. He pulls a map off the wall, miraculously avoiding a scythe trap immediately afterwards. At the same time Kleb finds collection of "important maps" on the bookshelf in study
		- Kleb's book is a mimic, which catches him by surprise but doesn't inflict too much damage
	- They collate maps and look everything over
