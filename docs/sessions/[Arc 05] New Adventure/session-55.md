# Guerilla Goblins
**2024-Mar-09**

- Kleb manages to offend a mage enough that she banishes him. When he returns a minute later, he finds himself in midair, since Rowan and Rulkorf decided to prank him by excavating the earth where he last stood
- The commune guide, a kenku, says it will be about a full day's hike to Yellyark. The party stocks up on rations but fails to find the niche spell components they were looking for
	- Rulkorf plays around with his fulgurite shard, attempting to cast some new cantrips. The focus remains frustratingly intert
	- Rowan practices picking some locks, to middling results
	- Kleb tries to show off with physical exercises, but has trouble with the weight of his armor
- Crow, the kenku, is nicknamed Ogden by Kleb. They set out, with Crow in front, then Kleb, followed by Beezer, then Rowan (carrying Eugene), and finally Rulkorf
	- Ogden at one point unfurls a raincatcher made of leaves, and uses it to fill everyone's waterskins
	- Partway through the journey, Ogden warns everyone to be careful of goblins, and Rulkorf casts Pass Without Trace
- After a few hours, and multiple paranoid false alarms, the party is still hiking. Eugene asks to get off, as Rowan is a bit hot to the touch. The group realizes they are under attack, and the paladin's armor is being magically heated
	- Rowan casts Armor of Agathys, trying to counter the heat with spectral frost. He mitigates the pain somewhat but fails to identify where the hostile spellcaster might be. Ogden climbs a tree both for protection and better sightlines
	- Two goblins pop out of the undergrowth and charge Rulkorf with their spears. They stumble a bit and do not damage him. Beezer throws a firebolt, but misses as well. Eugene, being the all-star he is, decapitates a goblin in one stroke of his shortsword
	- Kleb dumps the contents of his raincatcher onto Rowan's steaming armor, then attacks the other visible goblin with his sword. Rulkorf realizes that Heat Metal only requires sightlines on cast, and while it does have verbal components, the dwarf didn't hear anything. He looses a blind Tidal Wave, hoping to hit something
- Rowan spots a shimmer among the trees, and identifies some sort of necromantic magic being cast. Rulkorf feels the effects of a spell blurring his mind but shakes it off
	- A large saber-tooth tiger charges and swipes at Beezer, but gets nothing but air. Ogden fails to spot anything new from his perch
	- Kleb slashes the tiger a few times, bloodying it
	- Rulkorf spots one goblin further off in the trees, and presumes that must be the caster. He launches an ice shard, striking the caster, and the ensuing fragments break the enemy's concentration on Heat Metal
	- Rowan cannot reach the other goblin up in a tree, but he can certainly reach the tree. He smites the trunk with holy fervor, and the tree bursts apart, sending the goblin to the forest floor. Without giving a second to breathe, the paladin runs up and stabs him
	- Kleb is struck by the tiger, and Rowan is blown back by a wave of thunderous force from the goblin. Rulkorf is struck by a massive bolt of lightning, which is decidedly less fun than when the dwarf does it
	- Beezer and Eugene go on the offensive, with the latter knocking a goblin out of tiger form. Ogden jumps out of the tree and stabs the goblin with his knife
	- Kleb and Rulkorf fail to sniff out the goblin caster, but Rowan dispatches his prey. 
- Kleb is struck by the lightning, but avoids a severe hit, and Eugene finishes off the former sabertooth tiger. Kleb and Rulkorf, however, cannot find the goblin that is antagonizing them. The next time it pops out, Kleb tosses a fireball bead. The goblin is hit but not killed, and the party spends way too long playing whack-a-mole with it
	- Kleb ultimately spears it with his harpoon gun, and uses the tether to prevent it from hiding. As the group surrounds the goblin, he calls down one last lightning bolt, killing himself and damaging the party members
- With the enemies finally dispatched, Rowan heals Rulkorf (and they humor Beezer into thinking he actually helped)
	- Kleb searches the body, and identifies the caster's focus as a bunch of animal bones. The other goblin corpses have little of note besides spears
	- The different goblins have painted marks which seem to denote their proficiencies, e.g. fangs, skull markings, etc.
