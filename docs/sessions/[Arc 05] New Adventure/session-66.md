# Visitors at the Door
**2025-Mar-23**

- The martials need a long rest, so the party fortifies the Ladder room and settles in with Rulkorf on watch
- The dwarf sits crosslegged at the center of the three doors, listening for any disturbance outside. He hears thudding and dragging noises, and a few pairs of rotten undead feet stop before the door
	- He wakes up Rowan, knowing Kleb would panic at the thought of being surrounded by zombies
	- Suspecting the music emanating from the fireplace is attracing the undead (they are dressed as if for a ball), the palading tries to extinguish the fireplace with the contents of the waterskin. The music lulls briefly but restarts as the fire rekindles itself
- The pair steel their nerves and decide to hold steady. Over the next six hours, more zombies accumulate around each door but make no attempt to enter the room
- They wake up Kleb after 6 hours and inform him of the situation. Rowan protects Kleb from evil, preventing an anxiety attack
- Collect scattered caltrops and beads used as a trap while Kleb scouts out the situation from outside on his broom. The group decides the best course of action is to let the zombies in while they escape out the window, and reenter the mansion through another window on the ground floor
- Kleb ferries each of his compatriots to the Crusade room, leaving Rulkorf for last, who mage hands each of the three doors open. Dozens upon dozens of zombies file in and make their way to the window before the druid closes the doors behind them. They all wave to each other before flying away from the surprisingly patient and polite zombies
