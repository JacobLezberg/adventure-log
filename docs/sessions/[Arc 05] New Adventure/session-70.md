# The Dead Don't Shuffle
**2025-Aug-03**

- Realizing that Eugene is still missing, the party begin to search for him
- Kleb brings his horse into the Dead Room, triggering a round of Left 4 Dead 2
	- Inside, there is no Eugene, but the party meets another old veteran named Bill
	- They survive the onslaught just long enough to earn a key, but the horde overwhelms them before reaching the threshold for any bonuses
- The search resumes
	- Kleb notices the gelatinous cube that was occupying the stairwell is gone
	- Vibe room is suspiciously clean, likely because the gelatinous cube passed through here
	- Rulkorf wild shapes to a dire wolf and tries to track Eugene by scent, and failing to make progress, then hunts for the cube. Both are dead ends in the Vibe room
	- It turns out that Acererak was giving Eugene lunch (and allegedly having a homosexual tryst? Unconfirmed but Kleb is confident)
- The party begins a long rest in the Vibe room/corner tower. Rulkorf keeps watch while Kleb and Rowan restore themselves
