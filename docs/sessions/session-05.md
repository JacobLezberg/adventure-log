# Swaying Hearts and Minds

**2022-Jun-12**

- In the town center, [[the-party|the party]] makes a point to listen for gossip, specifically in regards to the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] member they humiliated earlier
  - The townsfolk seem to be of split opinion between the two "pill" factions
- [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] is immediately distracted by a pie seller and buys a double-stuf, deep-dish, meatlovers' pie
- [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] overhears two [[lozenge-azure|bluepill]] acolytes attempting to convert a merchant and decides that this cannot stand
  - He Wild Shapes into a skunk and heads towards them, which rouses the attention of most people in the square, but neither [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] nor [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] notice.
  - Backing away, one [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] member outruns Skunkorf, but the other trips and suffers the effects of a point-blank spray
  - Two Mintarn mercenaries rush to aid the man, but the skunk rushes around a corner and drops his transformation. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] steps out nonchalantly, the confused Mintarn hurry off, and the rest of the acolytes keep the victim at a distance because of his foul smell
- Celebrating their victory, [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] chokes on a bit of pie. He swats away any attempts by the others to help, but manages to avoid an untimely death after making a fool of himself
- As an escalatory step against the [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]], [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] hands his friends each large stacks of [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]] pamphlets, and they split up to plaster [[phandalin|Phandalin]] with them
  - The grassroots propaganda campaign proves very successful, and takes up the rest of the afternoon
- Later that evening, [[the-party|the party]] heads to the Stonehill Inn, and as they leave to check the Sleeping Giant for bluepills, a commotion can be heard coming from the town green
  - The [[nothic|Nothic]] has arrived! He's hopping from rooftop to rooftop, and [[rowan-chokrotsk|Rowan]] and [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] see bugbears approaching from the south as well.
  - Initially they assume that the bugbears are [[redbrands|Redbrands]] as well, but telepathically the pair hear a warning from the [[nothic|Nothic]] -- those aren't allies!
