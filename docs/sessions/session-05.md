# Swaying Hearts and Minds
**2022-Jun-12**

- In the town center, the party makes a point to listen for gossip, specifically in regards to the Lozenge Azure member they humiliated earlier
	- The townsfolk seem to be of split opinion between the two "pill" factions
- Kleb is immediately distracted by a pie seller and buys a double-stuf, deep-dish, meatlovers' pie
- Rulkorf overhears two bluepill acolytes attempting to convert a merchant and decides that this cannot stand
	- He Wild Shapes into a skunk and heads towards them, which rouses the attention of most people in the square, but neither Kleb nor Rowan notice.
	- Backing away, one Lozenge Azure member outruns Skunkorf, but the other trips and suffers the effects of a point-blank spray
	- Two Mintarn mercenaries rush to aid the man, but the skunk rushes around a corner and drops his transformation. Rulkorf steps out nonchalantly, the confused Mintarn hurry off, and the rest of the acolytes keep the victim at a distance because of his foul smell
- Celebrating their victory, Kleb chokes on a bit of pie. He swats away any attempts by the others to help, but manages to avoid an untimely death after making a fool of himself
- As an escalatory step against the Lozenge Azure, Kleb hands his friends each large stacks of Lozenge Gules pamphlets, and they split up to plaster Phandalin with them
	- The grassroots propaganda campaign proves very successful, and takes up the rest of the afternoon
- Later that evening, the party heads to the Stonehill Inn, and as they leave to check the Sleeping Giant for bluepills, a commotion can be heard coming from the town green
	- The Nothic has arrived! He's hopping from rooftop to rooftop, and Rowan and Rulkorf see bugbears approaching from the south as well.
	- Initially they assume that the bugbears are Redbrands as well, but telepathically the pair hear a warning from the Nothic -- those aren't allies!
