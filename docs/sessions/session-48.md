# Loose Lips Sink Ships?
**2023-Nov-19**

- Kleb deliberates over the folding boat and whether to signup for a store membership to get a 10% discount. If the trio pools their money, they can actually afford it. Ultimately, Kleb opts to make the purchase, signing Rowan's name to the (legally, but not magically binding) contract
	- The term of the membership is call-up reserve duty to guard the store for 1 year
	- The boat has 50hp and an AC of 11
- The party reconnects and goes out on the town. Kleb finds a druid-themed tavern called the Green Lady that is playing ye olde disco music
- Rulkorf stops by the Temple of Gond, picks up his newly-minted arcane focus, has an awkward but thankfully brief conversation with the priest-engineer, and leaves to meet the others.
- Kleb tries to chats up a dryad, although he is completely oblivious to her nature
	- She leads him away, and Rulkorf and Rowan cheer him on, but after a minute Rulkorf remembers that men who follow dryads into the woods normally don't return. The two of them decide to play it safe and trail the couple
- Kleb and the dryad disappear around a corner, and while the druid and paladin are unaware of this, the dryad is using some sort of magic to cloak them from view
- When Kleb abruptly pulls her aside for a kiss, he unknowingly breaks her concentration and drops Pass Without Trace
	- As the woman panics and tries to lead him towards/into a nearby tree, Kleb finally puts things together and realizes she might be a dryad
	- Kleb pushes her away, and realizing she won't be successful, the dryad melds into the street tree
	- Since Kleb did figure out her identity, Rulkorf lost his bet with Rowan, and begrudgingly hands over one of his last silver pieces
- Before calling it a night, the party decides to sate Rowan's worries and inspect the casino boat. The situation does seem a bit suspicious (and they are all a bit on edge from recent events)
	- They observe the docks for a bit and the workers seem to be loading it with provisions for the 8-day round trip to Camp Vengeance, along with some weapons and armor
- As the trio debrief on their way back to the inn, Kleb realizes he told the dryad exactly when and where they (and their boat) would be for the next week. His irresponsibility horrifies him, almost existentially
