The Harpers are a scattered network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or otherwise.

The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, although they interact and share information with one another. Harpers don't seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.

## Tenets
1. One can never have too much information.
2. Too much power leads to corruption.
3. No one should be powerless.

> The Harpers' goals are to gather information throughout Faer√ªn, discern the political dynamics within each region or realm, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful, and aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.
