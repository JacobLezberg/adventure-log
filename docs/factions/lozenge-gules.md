Followers of the Sigma Grindset, Alphas amongst Chads, Gods amongst lesser-jacked Gods. Diametrically opposed to [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]]. Official ideology of [[redbrands|the Redbrands]] and all truly self-actualized men, whether they are Going Their Own Way or otherwise. 

This organization is far flung and diffuse-- a small town is likely to contain at most one member of the Lozenge Gules but not more. Communications between members are maintained through use of town bulletin boards and the group's self-stated obligation to "pass it on, dog." Members are encouraged to engage in 
masculine activities: lifting, fighting, shit-talking, fucking, etc. Bookishness, self-doubt, physical weakness, "no bitches," and soy are seen as undesirable qualities (sins). Among members these sins are seen as correctible mis-steps, outsiders are less fortunate. Labeled as "betas" or "cucks," these men are shunned, mocked, assaulted, or --if lucky-- subjected to psycho-social pressure into converting. The [[lozenge-azure|Lozenge Azure]] is a group associated with these activities.
