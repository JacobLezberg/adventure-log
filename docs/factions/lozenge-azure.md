Buncha fuckin pussies, am I right?

Doesn't even know that [[lozenge-gules|Lozenge Gules]] exists (well, at least until [[kleb-fumpton|Kleb]] made his presence known in [[phandalin|Phandalin]]). Favored by [[lord-neverember|Lord Neverember]], and as a result the traveling groups of Lozenge Azure enjoy the protection of his mintarn mercenaries.

Tenets:
 1. Maintain order and peace
 2. Promote prosperity by offering everyone a place
