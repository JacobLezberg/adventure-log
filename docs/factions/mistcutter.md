Bounty-hunting ship that operated off the Sword Coast. [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] joined them when he left home and developed his combat and navigational skills while part of the crew. There was an incident that killed some of the crew, including the captain, and prompted the dwarf to leave this life.

## Members
- Zamar Urahi (Captain). Male Human, deceased. Strong leader, skilled with a sword and confident in the abilities of his crew.
- Blasius Stonefoot (one of the gunners). Male dwarf, deceased. One of [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]]'s dear friends--they didn't come from the same community but both ended up on the Mistcutter and were close because of their similar backgrounds.
- Ivellios Kominou (First mate). Male half-elf, living. Took over after Zamar was killed. Kind of a hardass, but he needed to be.
- Mirik (Shipwright). Female lizardfolk, living. Supremely handy and always seemed to appear where she was needed. Clever prankster as well.
- Ethinor Walker (Boatswain/Bosun) Female human, deceased. Worked with [[rulkorf-alpensinger|Rulkorf]] frequently and taught him the art of navigation. Looked down on his laziness but respected his skills.
- Hanano Borami (Cook). Male Human, living. Broad-shouldered and stout man who was very popular among the crew. Always said that you should never trust a skinny cook.
- There were a host of other seamen on board, mostly human, but a couple of the powder-monkeys were halflings and there were a few half-elves as well. The full crew consisted of roughly 50 people in total

## The Incident

	<summary>The Curse of [REDACTED]</summary>
	<p>One fateful morning, as the Mistcutter was chasing a group of corsairs across the Trackless Sea, they were beset by a sudden heavy storm which made navigation and pursuit difficult. The crew lost track of the pirates for a time, but managed to spot their ship heading towards a small foggy island. Happy to trade the storm for brume but calmer waters, Zamar ordered that they continue to give chase. However, when the Mistcutter arrived at the sheltered cove, they found the galley abandoned and beached with a gaping hole punched through its hull.</p>
  
	<p>Zamar sent his men to retrieve any supplies that could be salvaged from the wreck as well as all of the treasure that the pirates had stolen. He proceeded to disembark with a small party, including Rulkorf, to head deeper inland and hopefully recover some of their bounties. The group found only one survivor, a gibbering mess of a man who told them that he had seen his comrades torn apart by a coven of Sea Hags. Zamar didn't put much stock in the sailor's ravings, and ordered him taken prisoner.</p>
	  
	<p>As the group headed back to the ship with prisoner in tow, they too were attacked by the hags, who were furious at the theft of "their" prey and loot. Zamar and Rulkorf managed to slay one of the monsters together, but one by one Rulkorf's comrades were cut down, including Zamar. Realizing that he was the only one left, Rulkorf managed to flee by turning into a panther and outrunning the hags, but they chased him nearly all the way back to the cove. In his flight, Rulkorf heard the hags lob threats and curses at him. One sea hag in particular locked eyes with him as he looked back at the mob, and vowed that her wrath would not abate until he no longer drew breath.</p>
	  
	<p>The crew that remained by the ship quickly raised anchor and escaped the monsters, with Rulkorf explaining what happened once they were back at sea and the first mate had taken command of the vessel. The voyage back to Waterdeep was largely uneventful, but sometimes in stormy weather Rulkorf thought he could see a humanoid silhouette in the distance, outlined by the rain, trailing the Mistcutter and watching him.</p>
	  
	<p>After the ship limped into port, Rulkorf hoped to relax and recover from this ordeal. He didn't know what power the hags truly had to pursue him, but to his horror soon discovered that he was in fact being pursued by an air elemental (Invisible Stalker), which nearly killed him once in a surprise attack when he was resting. After this close call, the dwarf fled the city and set out on his own. Now Rulkorf is constantly traveling from place to place, nominally to satsify his wanderlust. In reality though, he's always looking over his shoulder, careful to never stay in one place for too long lest his past (literally) catch up with him.</p>
